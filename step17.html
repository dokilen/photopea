  <p>Let's add a quick artistic element to our image by inserting a nice light 
  reflection on our sun before we wrap up this long and very educational part of 
  this project.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space16</b> 
  	file in Photopea</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Flare</b></li>
    <li><b>Fill</b> the Flare layer with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Flare layer to <b>Linear Dodge</b></li>
    <li>Turn on the visibility of your Sun layer group</li>
	<li>Click <b>Filter</b> and point at <b>Render</b> and click<span class="style3"> Lens Flare</span> <span class="style2">
    <font color="#000000">(</font>the Lens Flare filter simulates the spots in a picture that results from light reflecting off a camera's lens<font color="#000000">)</font></span>
    to open the Lens Flare window...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="17/1701.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Note that you should also see a big white light on your scene - I have my 
	star field layer visible in the above image so you can see the lens flare 
	more clearly</li>
    <li>Click through each of the four <b>Type</b> options (listed as Lens 1, 2, 
	3, and 4 in the above image) and see what type of flare each selection 
	creates</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="style2">four Lens Types</span><font color="#FF0000"> represent different kinds of lenses you can put on real cameras</font>.</p>
<ol start="8">
    <li>Click the <b>Lens 1</b> option (just like the image above)</li>
    <li>Set the <b>Brightness</b> percentage to <b>
    125%</b> - this will give us a lens flare that is bright enough so that we 
    can see where it is and how it impacts our overall scene (keep in mind that 
    we will be able to adjust its brightness later)</li>
</ol>
<p>Your flare is probably sitting in the upper left region of your scene (it 
it's not, don't worry as we are about to move it), but we need it to stretch 
away from our sun, which should be sitting in one of the corners of our image.</p>
<ol start="10">
    <li>Move the Lens Flare window so that you can see your sun</li>
	<li>Click and drag the sliders for <b>Position X</b> and <b>Position Y</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="17/1702.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Until the bright dot of your lens flare sits on your sun, which for my image 
	is the location shown below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="17/1709.jpg" align="middle" width="574" height="520"><br>
    Note that these numbers work for me - your numbers may be different</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we click OK and commit to the creation of our lens flare, we need to 
make sure that all of it is visible on the screen. We need to confirm this 
because if any part out lens flare is cut off, those missing pieces will be 
obvious when we try to resize the flare. Take a close look at the corner of your 
space scene that is opposite your sun, you should something like the image 
below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="17/1703.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p>See that circle pointed at with the tiny red arrows? That circle is the part 
of the lens flare that is farthest away from the bright light. You need to make 
sure that you can see all of the circle just like the image above. If any part of 
the circle is cut off like the image 
below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="17/1704.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p>You will have problems in the next few directions because we are going to 
resize our flare and having a circle that is cut off is going to look really odd 
and not very realistic.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>Look over your lens flare - if part of it is cut off like the image above, 
  use the Position X and Position Y sliders to move your flare so that no part 
	of any of your circles are cut off</li>
	<li>When you are happy with your lens flare, click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
You should now have something similar to the image below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="17/1705.jpg" width="499" height="498" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">
    Our next task will be to shorten the flare so that it doesn't stretch across 
	the entire image. I could go into an entire explanation of how cameras work 
	and a shorter lens flare more accurately represents reality, but at this 
	point we are more interested in how the Photopea tools work, so let's skip 
	the long explanation and just talk about how to shorten the flare.</p>
  <ol start="14">
    <li>With the Flare layer selected, click <b>Edit</b> then click <b>Free 
    Transform</b></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key (this will ensure that both the 
	height and width of your flare changes at the same time) and then&nbsp; <b>click</b> and <b>drag</b> the resize handle opposite your sun 
	until your flare stretches about two-thirds of the way across your image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="17/1706.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>If you want your flare to sit at a different angle (in other words, not 
	go straight from one corner to the next), rotate the flare 
    until it sits at an angle you like - if you are happy with the current angle 
    of your flare, go to the next direction</li>
	<li>When you have your flare in a position you like, click the Confirm check 
	at the top of the Photopea window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="17/1710.jpg" width="371" height="83" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Decide if you are happy with how bright your flare is in comparison to the 
    rest of your scene (the flare should be an additional element in the image 
    and NOT the image's focal point), if you think it is too bright, simply lower the 
    Opacity of 
    the Flare layer until your flare is a brightness you like</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Flare layer...<br>
    <img border="0" src="17/1707.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>With all of your layer groups and layers turned on you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="17/1708.jpg" width="499" height="499" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">
    For the image you see above, I increased the size of the flare, rotated it 
    up just a bit so that most of the flare did not cover the planet, and lowered it's 
    Opacity to 50%.</p>
<ol start="20">
	<li>
	Click <b>File</b> and then click <b>Save as PSD</b></li>
	<li>
	Name the file <b>Space17</b></li>
</ol>
<p>This marks the end of <font color="#008080"><b>Part II: The Space Scene</b></font>. 
All we have left to do is get a nice spaceship with you as the pilot and get you 
flying through space, which is <b>
