  <p>In this step we will give our space scene a little color. No, seriously, 
  just a little color. Keep in mind as you work through this step that your 
  nebula should not be overly bold or bright as this will tend to make it stand 
  out and take away from the other items in your scene. We want to give our 
  scene a nice color that sits in the background with our star field and adds 
  some interesting variety and not some bold color that is the image's focal 
  point.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
  Open your <b>Space10</b> 
  file in Photopea</li>
    <li>
  <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard 
  (remember what this does?)</font></span></li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Nebula1</b> 
    - make sure this new layer is <b>NOT</b> in the Star Field folder group but 
    is above it in the layer stack...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1106.jpg" width="302" height="111"></li>
    <li> <b>Fill</b> the Nebula layer with <b>black</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1101.jpg"><br>
    and make sure the Nebula layer is selected</li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Nebula layer to <b>Linear 
  Dodge</b>...<b><br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="11/1107.jpg" width="302" height="168"><b><br>
	</b>&nbsp;Notice that you can now see your stars through the Nebula layer</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Lasso Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1102.jpg"><br>
    The <span class="style2">Lasso Tool allows us to make selections of any shape we like</span></li>
    <li>On the Lasso Tool Option Bar set the <b>Feather</b> to <b>75px</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1103.jpg"><br>
    This will give our nebula a nice, soft edge</li>
    <li><b>Click</b> and <b>drag</b> to create a region to place 
  your first nebula - it can be anywhere you want and any shape you want, but remember that if you 
    place 
  it where you placed your bright stars they will become difficult to see...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1104.jpg"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Notice that when you release the mouse after drawing your selection area that 
  the selection will change, sometimes dramatically, to be more rounded than 
  your original area...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="11/1105.jpg" width="332" height="333"></p>
<p>This happens because the feather is set so high that the selection will have 
very spread out edges. This is what we want at this point.</p>
  <ol start="9">
    <li>
  <span class="style2"><font color="#000000">Click the <b>Swap Colors</b> icon to set white as your Foreground color and black as your 
  background color...<br>
	</font></span>
    <img border="0" src="11/1118.jpg" width="45" height="99"></li>
    <li>
Change the <b>Foreground color</b> to the color you want your nebula to 
  be - it should be a dark shade and <b>NOT</b> bright or your nebula clouds will look 
  unnatural...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1108.jpg" width="669" height="333"><br>
Notice how the bright pink on the left looks unnatural and could even be some 
space blob that is about to eat our solar system, where the darker color on the 
right gives us the slight color we want - we don't want too much color at this 
point as we will be adding in more clouds (including different colored clouds) 
in the coming directions</li>
    <li>
Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click 
  <b>Clouds</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1109.jpg"></li>
    <li>
You should now have something similar to the image below 
  (no, yours will not look just like mine)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1110.jpg" width="590" height="591"></li>
    <li>
If you think the nebula is too bright or you don't like the 
  shape you can undo and try again, or you can simply use the Eraser Tool to remove 
some of the clouds until you get something you do like (be advised: of you use 
an eraser DO NOT use one with a hard edge - it will not look natural)</li>
    <li>
<b>Repeat</b> the above procedure several more times until you 
  have a nicely built nebula; keep the following in mind as you build your 
  nebula:<ol type="a"><li>
Place each new shape and color <b>on its own 
  layer</b></li><li>
Name each new layer you create in numeric sequence: Nebula1, Nebula2, Nebula3, 
etc.</li><li>
Create a nebula with AT LEAST 2 different colors - you can certainly have more, 
but don't go crazy (there are very few real nebula with more than a handful of 
different colors)</li><li>
Feel free to use a variety of colors as you create your nebula, but make your color shifts small (for example from blue to 
<a href="http://www.acfamerica.org/assets/images/Turquoise.JPG">turquoise</a> or from purple to 
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XFgi3qy6AZo/T5IlVqby3wI/AAAAAAAAAVA/cRvQQ4MVLA8/s1600/Lavender.jpg">lavender</a>) or the nebula will look unnatural</li><li>
Do not use black or white</li><li>
Do not try to fill the entire image with color</li><li>
Be sure to set the blending mode of each nebula layer to <b>Linear Dodge</b></li><li>
Try not to make sections of the 
  nebula too dark - you should always be able to see the stars through your clouds</li><li>
Try to make some areas of color larger and some areas smaller - this will add to 
the realism</li><li>
When trying to make small areas of color, you may find that the selection area 
you are drawing disappears when you release the mouse button. If this happens, 
don't panic. <font color="#FF0000">This is because the shape you are drawing is 
smaller than the 75 pixel feather we defined earlier</font>. One solution to 
this is to decrease the feather - but be careful not to decrease it below 50 or 
your areas of color will be too solid.</li>
  </ol>
    <li><b>Select</b> all of the nebula layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1111.jpg"><br>
    (You may have more or less nebula layers - 
    this is OK) and <b>click</b> on the <b>New Folder </b>icon</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the folder group you just made <b>Nebula</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="11/1112.jpg"></li>
    <li>Take a look at your nebula and make sure it is not too bright - look at 
    this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1113.jpg" width="250" height="250"><br>
    Notice that the nebula is so bright that you can not see the stars through 
    it - your nebula should be a splash of color that sits in the background of 
    your image to add interest and variety to your space scene and not a bold 
    area of color that screams 'look at me!' - if your nebula is too bright, you 
    can quickly and easily soften it up by decreasing the <font color="#FF0000"> <b>opacity</b> (the depth of color)</font> of the 
    Nebula folder group to get it down to something more realistic. Simply make sure your Nebula 
	folder group is selected in your Layers panel (it 
    should be highlighted in gray as in the image below) then click the
    <font color="#FF0000"> <b>Opacity 
    drop down arrow</b></font> (<font color="#FF0000">1</font> in the image below) and grab 
    the <font color="#FF0000"> <b>Opacity slider</b></font> (<font color="#FF0000">2</font> in the image below) and drag it to the left (<font color="#FF0000">3</font> 
    in the image below)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1114.jpg"><br>
    Until your nebula is a nice soft color and you can see your 
    stars through it...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1115.jpg" width="250" height="250"><br>
    Keep in mind that the images in this step are screenshots and thus are not 
    as detailed and pretty as your nebula should be</li>
  </ol>
  When you have completed your nebula, you should have something similar 
    to the image below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="11/1116.jpg" width="499" height="500"></p>
  <ol start="18">
    <li><b>Lock</b> the <b>Nebula</b> folder group...<br>
    <img border="0" src="11/1117.jpg"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Keep in mind that we will be adding planets (and a bunch of other stuff), so 
	parts of our nebula 
  will 
  be covered up. If there is an area (or areas) that you do not like, don't worry about it 
  right now. You can stick a planet over the problem area so that it won't show in the final image.</p>
  <ol start="19">
    <li>Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save as PSD</b></li>
	<li>Name the file <b>Space11</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Time to add in a sun.</p>
