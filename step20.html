<p>All we have left to do is bring our spaceship into our space scene and make 
it move. While intricate and complicated animations are certainly possible in 
Photopea, let's do something simple so we can get an idea of how creating 
movements in Photopea works. Keep in mind that the same process we are about to go through can 
be expanded to make the animation as complex as we want.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your <b>Space</b> file in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl+Alt+A</b> to Select all of the layers and layer groups and 
  then press <b>Ctrl+E</b> to merge all layers together</li>
</ol>
At this point we should save a new version of our space scene so that our <b>
Space</b> file (that contains all of our separate layers) will still be saved in 
our folder in case we want to make changes to it at a later time (and so that 
our work up to this point can be graded).<p align="center">
<b><font size="5">AGAIN,
<u>DO NOT</u> SAVE YOUR SPACE FILE WITH THE 
LAYERS MERGED - <br>
YOU WILL <u>NOT</u> BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THE LAYERS LATER <br>
AND YOU WILL LOSE POINTS WHEN YOUR WORK IS GRADED!</font></b></p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>
Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save As...</b> and make sure you 
are in the <b>Photopea</b> folder within your main folder
  </li>
  <li>
Change the file name to <b>step20.psd</b>
  </li>
  <li>
Click <b>Save</b> - notice that the title bar for your image now 
says you are working with the <b>step20.psd</b> file...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2001.jpg" width="245" height="42"><br>
This is good...this is what we want</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that we now have our step20.psd file with a single layer saved in 
our folder, but also have our original Space.psd file in our folder with all of 
the separate layers still intact. Now let's get our spaceship into our space 
scene.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Rename the layer you merged in direction 2 to <b>Space</b></li>
  <li>Open your <b>Spaceship</b> file in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li><b>Position</b> your two files so you can see them both at the same time</li>
  <li>Using the <b>Move Tool</b>, click on your spaceship and drag it onto your 
  Space file - notice that Photopea places your spaceship in a new layer 
  group...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2019.jpg" width="239" height="97"></li>
  <li><b>Right-click</b> the layer group containing your spaceship and click <b>
  Merge Group</b>...<b><br>
  </b><img border="0" src="20/2020.jpg" width="290" height="110"><b><br>
  </b>Your spaceship should now be sitting on a normal layer</li>
  <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer containing your spaceship to <b>1</b> (yes, just the number 
  <b>1</b> - I'll 
  explain why in just a second)</li>
  <li>Close your <b>Spaceship</b> file - if Photopea asks if you want to save 
  changes choose <b>No</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Your wonderful spaceship image should now be floating somewhere in your space 
scene...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2002.jpg" width="331" height="216"></p>
<p align="left">OK, let's get everything into place so we can start flying.</p>
<ol start="13">
  <li>
<p align="left">Determine how large you want your spaceship to be 
- I am going to leave mine the size it is - feel free to make yours smaller if 
you wish (<b>DO NOT make it larger</b>), but be sure that no matter what size 
you make it that you can still read your name easily</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">We now need to move our spaceship into the correct position to 
start our timeline.</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li>Using the <b>Move Tool</b>, click and drag your spaceship all the way to the left 
  of your image until it is off of your canvas and out of your space scene - yes, we want it to be out 
  of the picture to the left (don't worry, you are not getting rid of it, just 
  moving it so far to the left that it can't be seen)</li>
</ol>
<p>This may seem like an odd way to start, but we want our ship to appear to 
come in from the left and fly off the right, so we need to start with it off the 
screen to the left then have it gradually appear as it flies. If you are not 
getting this, don't worry - you will understand as we do this.</p>
<p><i><b>One quick word of advice:</b></i> if your window looks like this...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2003.jpg" width="362" height="382"></p>
<p>You may notice that you are unable to drag your spaceship off the left side 
of your image. Don't panic - nothing is wrong. This is simply because there is 
no space around your image for the spaceship to go into. The fix for this is 
easy: click on the title bar of your window and drag the window up until your 
cursor is at the very bottom of the Option bar. You will notice that your image 
will turn almost transparent and that a blue line will pop up along the bottom 
of the Option bar and down the side of the Tools panel...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2004.jpg" width="311" height="180"></p>
<p>This blue line indicates that when you release the mouse that your image will 
occupy the entire Photopea window. Release the mouse - your image should now be surrounded by gray 
(if not, simply zoom out a little bit) and you can now drag your spaceship off 
your canvas and out of your space scene.</p>
<p align="left">We now need to create additional layers and gradually move our 
spaceship across the screen.</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li><b>Right-click</b> the <b>1</b> layer and click <b>Duplicate Layer</b></li>
  <li>Name the new layer <b>2</b> (yes, just the number <b>2</b>)</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to click and drag your spaceship to the right 
  until you can just see the side of your head...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2005.jpg" width="166" height="207"></li>
  <li><b>Repeat</b> the above three directions over and over and over and over 
  and over and over, each time moving your spaceship little by little to the 
  right and naming each new layer you create in sequence (<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, 
  etc.) until your spaceship is no longer visible off the right side of your 
  image</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to move your spaceship by the same amount each time so that the animation 
runs smoothly. If you move it too far on any of the new layers then your ship will 
  appear to leap great distances as it flies through space. When you reach the other side 
  of your space scene you should have multiple 
  numbered layers and your image should look something like the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="20/2006.jpg" width="525" height="526"></p>
<p>Remember that your spaceship can follow any path you like - you can even have 
it do loops or get smaller so that it appears to fly away from us, then larger 
again if you want. You can even have it disappear behind one of your planets (be 
sure to make it really small at it goes into orbit) and appear on the other 
side.</p>
<p>Time to create the animation timeline.</p>
<ol start="19">
  <li>Click <b>Window</b> then click <b>Timeline</b> to activate the Timeline 
  panel - this should display at the bottom of your screen...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2007.jpg" width="777" height="127"><br>
  You want it to look like the image above - which is called <b>frame animation</b> view 
  - which is showing you each frame of 
  your timeline; if your Timeline panel looks like this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2008.jpg" width="776" height="154"><br>
  don't worry, <font color="#FF0000">you can switch to the </font> <span class="style1">frame animation view by clicking the little button 
  in the bottom left-hand corner of the panel that looks like three little 
  gray boxes</span>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2009.jpg" width="107" height="52"><br>
  If you get a message that says 'This will convert the timeline to a frame 
  animation.' simply click <b>Continue</b></li>
  <li>Be sure you are in <b>frame animation</b> view</li>
  <li>In the Layers panel, turn off the <b>visibility</b> of every layer 
  except <b>Space</b> and layer <b>1</b> - note that you can quickly turn off 
  the visibility of multiple layers by clicking on the first layer visibility 
  icon and dragging up across the rest of them...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2021.jpg" width="302" height="274"><br>
  Photopea will automatically scroll up when you reach the top of your layer 
  stack so you can turn off the visibility without having to click multiple 
  times</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice at this point that the thumbnail on the Timeline panel no longer has 
all of the spaceship images and should now only be your space scene (remember 
that you can't see your spaceship on layer 1 because it is off the image to the 
left)</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>Click the <b>fly-out menu</b> in the top right corner of the Timeline 
  panel...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2010.jpg" width="135" height="60"></li>
  <li>Click<span class="style3"> <span class="style1"><b>Make Frames From Layers</b>...</span></span><span class="style1"><br>
    <img border="0" src="20/2011.jpg" width="282" height="145"><br>
    After thinking for a second, Photopea will create frames in the timeline from each of your 
existing layers<font color="#000000">...</font><br>
  </span>
  <img border="0" src="20/2012.jpg" width="818" height="136"></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see above, our new frames are simply our spaceship/head at 
different positions in our space scene. You can scroll to the right in the 
Timeline panel to confirm that you have the same number of frames as you do 
layers. Photopea was able to create these frames in sequence because we named 
our layers in numerical order 
(meaning 1, 2, 3, etc.). See, I told you we had a reason for naming 
them the way we did.</p>
<p>Let's take a second to look at the <span class="style1">animation control buttons</span> 
that sit at the bottom of the 
Timeline 
panel (take notes on their names)...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2013.jpg" width="276" height="212"></p>
<p>Let's play our animation now and see what we have so far.</p>
<ol start="24">
  <li>Click the <b>Plays animation</b> button and watch your image - you should 
  see the space scene pop up then disappear, and then your spaceship should fly across the 
  screen on a transparent background (this is what we want at this point)</li>
  <li>Click on <b>frame 2</b> in the <b>Timeline panel</b> then turn the visibility 
  of the <b>Space</b> layer on - notice that you can now see the space scene in 
  both frames 1 and 2 but not in the other frames...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2014.jpg" width="483" height="136"></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> on <b>frame 3</b> then press and hold the <b>Shift</b> 
  key on the keyboard and click on the <b>last</b> frame of your timeline - 
  this should select all frames EXCEPT frames 1 &amp; 2 (the selected frames should now be highlighted in 
  gray...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2022.jpg" width="818" height="136"></li>
  <li>Release the <b>Shift</b> key</li>
  <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of the <b>Space</b> layer on</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Plays animation</b> button once again - your spaceship should now be 
  flying through space in each frame</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that what you see on each frame of the timeline depends on which layers 
are visible in each frame, and that you can make different layers visible or invisible on 
different frames of your timeline.</p>
<p>You may notice that your spaceship is moving really fast - this is because we 
have not set the <span class="style1">frame delay time (or how long each frame should stay on the screen before 
being replaced by the next frame)</span> for each frame yet. Let's do that now.</p>
<ol start="30">
  <li><b>Click</b> on <b>frame 1</b> then press and hold the <b>Shift</b> 
  key on the keyboard and click on the <b>last</b> frame of your timeline to 
  select every one of your frames</li>
  <li>Click the <span class="style1"><b>Selects frame delay time</b></span><span class="style2"> button</span> on frame number <b>1</b> 
  (the button circled in the image below)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2015.jpg" width="253" height="125"></li>
  <li>Click <b>0.1 seconds</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2016.jpg" width="175" height="264"><br>
  This will set each frame in your timeline to flash on the screen for 0.1 
  seconds before being replaced by the next frame</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Plays animation</b> button - your spaceship should now be 
  flying through space at a nice speed</li>
</ol>
<p>We now need to save our animation.</p>
<ol start="34">
  <li>Click <b>File</b> and then click <b>Export</b> and then click <b>Save for Web 
  (Legacy)...<br>
  </b>
  <img border="0" src="20/2023.jpg" width="558" height="424"><b><br>
  </b>This will open the Save for 
  Web window...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2017.jpg" width="992" height="763"></li>
  <li>Make all of the setting match the options selected in the image above</ol>
<p>Keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul><li>The <span class="style2">GIF setting means the image will be saved in a format that allows it to 
  be an animated image</span><li class="style3">Setting <span class="style2">Looping Options: to Forever means the 
  animation will repeat non-stop</span></li><li class="style3">The maximum 
  setting for Colors is 256 because that is the maximum number of colors the GIF 
  file format allows</li><li class="style3">Dither is the process where two 
  colors that are present in the image are placed next to each other to make it 
  look like a third non-present color is there, so we end up with an 
  image that appears to have more colors in it than it actually does</li>
  </ul>
<ol start="36">
  <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button</li>
  <li>Go to your student folder and go into your <b>Photopea</b> 
  folder and name the file <b>Final</b> (Photopea will add the .GIF extension 
  automatically)</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button - Photopea will think for a second and then 
  your image will be saved</li>
</ol>
Let's have a quick look at our image to make sure everything saved correctly and 
it works like it should.<ol start="39">
  <li>Go to your <b>Photopea</b> folder inside your student folder and 
  <b>right-click</b> on your <b>Final</b> file then point at <b>Open with</b> 
  and click <b>Internet Explorer</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2018.jpg" width="461" height="216"><br>
  Actually, you can use any browser you want to open the image</li>
  <li>You should now be able to see your flying spaceship...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2019.gif" width="224" height="224"><br>
  If you are not flying through space, or if you do not have a smooth animation, 
  return to Photopea and correct any problems</li>
  <li><b>Close</b> the browser</li>
  <li><b>Save</b> your <b>step20.psd</b> file (remember, you should <i><b>NOT</b></i> be 
  saving the work you did on this step as Space!)</li>

<p>We are now done with the Astronaut Space Scene project - good job!</p>
