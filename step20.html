<p>All we have left to do is bring our spaceship into our space scene and make 
it move. While intricate and complicated animations are certainly possible in 
Photopea, let's do something simple so we can get an idea of how creating 
motion in Photopea works. Keep in mind that the same process we are about to go through can 
be expanded to make the animation as complex as we want.</p>
<p>Let's start by turning all of the existing layers and layer folders of our 
Space17 file into a 
single layer. This will reduce the file size of our image which will help to 
prevent the program from lagging when we are creating the multiple layers we 
need to make our spaceship fly.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your <b>Space17</b> file in <b>Photopea</b></li>
	<li>Make sure the <b>visibility</b> of <b>all</b> of your layers and layer 
	folders is turned on so you can see all of your wonderful work (you should 
	be able to see your Star Field, Nebula, Sun, Planet1, Planet2, Comet, 
	Asteroids, and Lens Flare)</li>
  <li><b>Right-click</b> your <b>Flare</b> layer, which should be at the top of 
	your layer stack, and click <b>Flatten Image</b>...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2024.jpg"><br>
	Notice that you now have a single layer...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2025.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Flatten Image takes everything within the image, 
doesn't matter if it is an individual layer or an entire layer group, and turns 
it all into a single layer</font>.</p>
At this point we should save a new version of our space scene so that our <b>
Space17</b> file (that contains all of our separate layers) will still be saved in 
our folder in case we want to make changes to it at a later time (and so that 
our work up to this point can be graded).<p align="center">
<b><font size="5">AGAIN,
<u>DO NOT</u> SAVE YOUR SPACE17 FILE WITH THE 
LAYERS MERGED - <br>
YOU WILL <u>NOT</u> BE ABLE TO SEPARATE THE LAYERS LATER <br>
AND YOU WILL LOSE POINTS WHEN YOUR WORK IS GRADED!</font></b></p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>
Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save as PSD</b></li>
  <li>
Name the file <b>Step20.psd</b> 
  </li>
  <li>
Click <b>Save</b> - notice that the title bar for your image still says that you are working with 
the <b>Space17</b> file...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2001.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>We now have our Step20.psd file with a single layer saved to our device, but also have our original Space17.psd file with all of 
the separate layers still intact. Now let's get our spaceship into our space 
scene. We want to continue working with the Step20 file, so let's take a second 
to close the Space17 file and open up the Step20 file.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li><b>Close</b> the <b>Space17</b> file by clicking the X indicated below...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2026.jpg" width="308" height="114"></li>
	<li>Click <b>Open From Computer</b> (or click File and then click Open) and 
	then <b>double-click</b> the <b>Step20</b> file to open it in Photopea</li>
	<li>Rename the layer (there should only be one) to <b>Space<br>
	</b>
<img border="0" src="20/2027.jpg" width="321" height="109"></li>
  <li>Open your <b>Spaceship19</b> file in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> on the <b>Pilot</b> layer folder and <b>drag</b> it onto the 
	Step20 file tab...<br>
<img border="0" src="20/2028.jpg"><br>
	Notice that Photopea places your spaceship in a new layer 
  group...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2019.jpg"></li>
  <li><b>Right-click</b> the Pilot layer folder and then click <b>
  Merge Layers</b>...<b><br>
  </b><img border="0" src="20/2020.jpg"><b><br>
  </b>Your spaceship should now be sitting on a normal layer that is still named 
	Pilot</li>
  <li><b>Rename</b> the Pilot layer to <b>_a_1</b> (yes, it's a strange name - I'll 
  explain why we are using that in just a second)...<br>
	<img border="0" src="20/2029.jpg"></li>
  <li>Close your <b>Spaceship19</b> file</li>
</ol>
<p>Your wonderful spaceship image should now be sitting in the upper-left hand 
corner of your space 
scene...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2002.jpg"></p>
<ol start="15">
	<li>
	<p align="left">Determine how large you want your spaceship to be 
- I am going to leave mine the size it is - feel free to make yours smaller if 
you wish (<b>DO NOT make it larger</b>), but be sure that no matter what size 
you make it that you can still read your name easily</p></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p align="left">To create an animation in Photopea, we first need to create the 
individual layers that will become the frames of the animation. When viewing an 
animation, nothing is actually 'moving', instead you are being shown a series of 
pictures where the items that appear to move are in a slightly different place 
in each image. Talk a look at this image...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2030.jpg" width="795" height="200"></p>
<p align="left">Notice how the cartoon giraffe is in a different position each 
time. If I show you each image quickly in order, you will see this...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2031.gif" width="256" height="195"></p>
<p align="left">Kinda freaky to realize that when you watch a movie or TV show 
that you are not actually watching anything move.....it's just a bunch of 
pictures flashed at you really quick (usually 24 pictures a second). We can use 
this method to make an animation in Photopea by placing each individual image on 
its own layer. When we export our image as a GIF, PNG, or WEBP file (all file 
types that support animation), Photopea detects all layers starting with&nbsp;<b>_a_</b>.
<font color="#FF0000">By using _a_ in the name of the file, Photopea knows we 
want our image to animated</font>. Every layer, or even a layer folder, whose 
name starts with _a_ will be a frame in the animation. The first layer named 
with this pattern is shown in the first frame (others starting with&nbsp;_a_&nbsp;are 
hidden on that frame), the second layer is shown in the second frame, and so on. 
This is why we named our first layer _a_1 back in direction 12.</p>
<p align="left">We now need to move our spaceship into the correct position to 
start our animation. We want our ship to appear to 
come in from the left and fly off the right, so we need to start with it off the 
screen to the left then have it gradually appear as it flies to the right. If you are not 
getting this, don't worry - you will understand as we do this.</p>
<ol start="16">
  <li>Using the <b>Move Tool</b>, click in the center of your spaceship and drag 
	it all the way to the left 
  of your image until it is off of your canvas and out of your space scene - yes, we want it to be out 
  of the picture to the left (don't worry, you are not getting rid of it, just 
  moving it so far to the left that it can't be seen) - note that you may need 
	to zoom out to see the area to the left of your image</li>
	<li>As you move your spaceship, keep an eye on the left side of your space 
	scene and look for a red line like the one circled below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2007.jpg"><br>
	Decide where you want your spaceship to come into your space scene at - it 
	can be anywhere along the left side - and release the mouse to drop your 
	spaceship at a spot where you can see the red line along the edge</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#FF0000">The red line along the edge is letting you know that 
the right edge of your spaceship file is aligned with the left edge of your 
space scene file</font>. This system works in other locations while your image 
is off the canvas. For example, if you drag your spaceship to the top of your canvas 
a red line will appear...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="20/2003.jpg"></p>
<p>This red line indicates that that the top of the object 
you are moving (which for us is our spaceship) is 
now aligned with the top of the canvas. These red lines are very helpful in getting 
things lined up. Note that a red line will appear in the center when your 
spaceship is aligned in the center, and a red line will appear at the bottom 
when the bottom of the spaceship is aligned with the bottom of your canvas. 
Remember that you can place your spaceship anywhere you want along the left edge 
of your space scene.</p>
<p align="left">We now need to create additional layers and gradually move our 
spaceship across the screen.</p>
<ol start="18">
  <li><b>Right-click</b> the <b>_a_1</b> layer and click <b>Duplicate Layer</b> 
	- note that Photopea names the duplicate layer <b>_a_1 copy</b>...<b><br>
	</b>
  <img border="0" src="20/2008.jpg" width="323" height="166"></li>
  <li>Rename the new layer <b>_a_2</b></li>
  <li>Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to click and drag your spaceship to the right 
  until you can just see the side of your head...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2005.jpg" width="166" height="207"></li>
  <li><b>Repeat</b> the above three directions over and over and over and over 
  and over and over, each time moving your spaceship little by little to the 
  right and naming each new layer you create in sequence (<b>_a_3</b>, <b>_a_4</b>, <b>
	_a_5</b>, <b>_a_6</b>, 
  etc.) until your spaceship is no longer visible off the right side of your 
  image</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to move your spaceship by the same amount each time so that the animation 
runs smoothly. If you move it too far on any of the new layers then your ship will 
  appear to leap great distances as it flies through space. When you reach the other side 
  of your space scene you should have multiple 
  numbered layers and your image should look something like the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="20/2006.jpg" width="525" height="526"></p>
<p>Remember that your spaceship can follow any path you like - you can even have 
it do loops or get smaller so that it appears to fly away from us, then larger 
again if you want. You can even have it disappear behind one of your planets (be 
sure to make it really small at it goes into orbit) and appear on the other 
side.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's take a quick look at our animation to make sure everything moves like 
we want.</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>Click <b>File</b> and point at <b>Export</b> as and then click <b>PNG</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2009.jpg"><br>
	This will open the <b>Save for web</b> window...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2004.jpg" width="605" height="478"></li>
</ol>
<p>If you allow the Save for web window to sit for just a second, you should see 
your ship fly by. Because our image is so large, we can't see the entire scene. 
This is easy to fix.</p>
<ol start="23">
  <li>Point at the space scene and roll the mouse wheel down until the zoom 
	indicator reads 50.00%...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2010.jpg"><br>
	You should now be able to see your spaceship move across your entire space 
	scene</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the various options in the Save for web window, we can control the 
appearance of our animated image.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="10">
	<tr>
		<td width="293">
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <p align="center">

  <img border="0" src="20/2011.jpg"></td>
		<td>Format - Defines the type of image we are creating<p>Width and 
		Height - Allows us to change the size of the image</p>
		<p>Quality - Lowering the percentage will not only create a lower 
		quality image, but will also decrease the file size of the image (this 
		is helpful if file size is more important than image quality)</p>
		<p>Speed - Controls how quickly our object moves through the image, so 
		in our case clicking and dragging the slider will either increase or 
		decrease the speed at which our spaceship travels through our space 
		scene</p>
		<p>Repeat - Defines how many times the animation repeats (setting this 
		to 0 causes the animation to repeat continuously)</p>
		<p>reverse frames - Will flip our frames so that the animation runs in 
		the opposite directions (in other words, your spaceship will fly 
		backwards if you select it)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>We are going to leave most of the setting above alone, but we do need to make 
a small adjustment to the Speed. We want our spaceship to move as smoothly as 
possible through our space scene (and we want it to get quickly to the other 
side). With Speed set to 100%, this is the animation we get...</p>
<p align="center">

  <img border="0" src="20/2012.gif" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p align="left">If we get our spaceship to move a little faster, we can smooth 
out the animation. By default, <font color="#FF0000">each frame will be shown for 50 ms before being replaced by the 
next frame</font>. In fact, Photopea allows you to specify the exact amount of 
time each layer will be visible in the animation. To do this, simply place a 
comma after the layer name and then indicate the number of milliseconds 
(thousands of a seconds, so 1000 would be one second) the frame should display 
before being replaced by the next frame. For example, if I named my first layer 
_a_1,500 then that frame would stay on screen for half a second.</p>
<p>Being able to specifically control the amount of time each frame displays is 
important, because it allows us to create variations in our animation...</p>
<p align="center">

  <img border="0" src="20/2013.gif" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>Notice how the spaceship in the above animation comes in quickly, slows down 
as it reaches the center, and then speeds up again as it exits the scene. I did this by 
gradually increasing the number on each layer to make that frame display longer, 
as you can see from the several layers shown below...</p>
<p align="center">

  <img border="0" src="20/2015.jpg"></p>
<p>When my spaceship reached the center of the image, I simply reversed the 
numbers so that it sped up as it exited. For this project, you do not have to 
worry about trying to pull off anything like this (though if you have time and 
want to try, go for it), we will go with the much easier method of letting 
Photopea set the same value for all frames.</p>
<ol start="24">
	<li>Increase the Speed setting to a value between 120 and 160 - I'm not 
	going to give you an exact amount here, you are free to set it to whatever 
	you like...<br>

  <img border="0" src="20/2017.jpg" width="257" height="312"><br>
	I'm going to set my value to 140 - to change the value you can either click 
	on the blue dot and drag it to the right, of you can type the amount in 
	directly (if you type the amount in, you can just click on the area with the 
	red circle in the above image to commit the number change</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that when you change the Speed that Photopea will pause for a second and 
then show you the animation at the new speed, so don't freak out when things 
don't happen instantly.</p>
<ol start="25">
  <li>Once your spaceship moves in a way that you are happy with, click the <b>Save</b> button...<br>
  <img border="0" src="20/2016.jpg" width="257" height="226"></li><li>Go to the folder 
	where you are saving your Photopea work and name the file <b>Final</b> (Photopea will add the .GIF extension

  your image will be saved</li></ol>Let's have a quick look at our image to make sure everything saved correctly and 
it works like it should.<ol start="28">
