  <p>We could just create a large glowing white spot and call it our sun, but 
  that would be a pretty boring sun. Take a look the following view of the 
  sun...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1201.gif" width="470" height="418"></p>
  <p align="left">Yes, that is the actual sun. It was filmed using a special 
  filter that removes the glare and allows you to see the surface of the sun. 
  Notice that it is a very interesting and dynamic object. In this step, we are 
  going to try and create a sun that is similar to this one (ok, our sun will 
  not rotate, but it will look way more awesome).</p>
  <p align="left">Keep the following important fact in mind...</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><a name="important"></a>YOUR SUN SHOULD REMAIN 
  SELECTED FROM DIRECTION 8 THRU DIRECTION 37. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DESELECT YOUR 
  SUN, YOU CAN RESELECT IT BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE Ctrl KEY AND CLICKING 
  ON THE SUN LAYER'S THUMBNAIL</font><font size="4">. <br>
  </font></b>(A layer's thumbnail is the little picture between the eyeball 
  and the layer name)<br>
  <span class="style1">(Ctrl+thumbnail click will select all of the non-transparent pixels on 
  the layer)</span></p>
  <p align="left">In other words, if you begin work on your sun but have to stop 
  before you are finished and come back to it at a later time, then you will need 
  to reselect the sun before you can continue with the tutorial.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space11</b> 
  	file in Photopea</li>
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of the Star Field and Nebula folder groups off 
    (they should both be locked)</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Sun</b> - make sure the Sun layer 
    is selected and is at the top of the layer stack...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1201.jpg"></li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard to make sure <b>Set foreground color</b> is <b>black</b> and 
    <b>Set background color</b> is <b>white</b></li>
    <li>Set the <font color="#FF0000"> <b>Zoom</b> to <b>100</b>% (the keyboard shortcut for this is
	<b>Ctrl+1</b></font>)</li>
    <li>Select the <b>Ellipse Select</b> tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1202.jpg"><br>
    If you do not see the Ellipse Select tool, it is likely because you have 
    the Rectangle Select tool selected - right-click the Rectangle Select tool and then select the Ellipse 
	Select tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1229.jpg"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>feather</b> is set to <b>0px</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1230.jpg"></li>
	<li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then <b>Click and drag</b> to create a circle in the center of your canvas 
    (holding the <b>Shift</b> key as you drag makes sure the circle is 
    perfectly round, if your sun is an oval you will lose points!) - the circle should be fairly large, remember that 
    <font color="#FF0000">images 
    lose very little quality when shrunk but can lose a large amount of 
    quality when increased in size</font></li>
	<li>Use the <b>Paint Bucket tool</b> to fill the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with 
	<b>black</b>...<b><br></b>
	<img border="0" src="12/1203.jpg" width="379" height="388"></li>
	<li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Difference 
    Clouds</b>...<b><br></b>
	<img border="0" src="12/1204.jpg"></li>
  </ol>
<p>The Difference Clouds filters work similar to the Cloud filter in that a 
random pattern of color between the values of the foreground and background 
colors are generated, but Difference Clouds an extra step is added that inverts 
portions of the selection area so that darker and more bold patterns are 
created. By repeatedly applying the Difference Clouds filter we can generate 
stronger and stronger 'lines' within the cloud, similar to the lines seen in a 
piece of marble.</p>
<ol start="11">
	<li>Press <span class="style1"><b>Ctrl+Alt+F</b> (this just reapplies the last filter you applied)</span> 
    multiple times until you get a pattern that you 
    like - try to get a pattern with some dark streaks  and lots of bright areas 
    - you should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
	<img border="0" src="12/1205.jpg" width="295" height="292"><br>
	Let me repeat - you want more light areas than dark areas</li>
	<li>We need to make things a little brighter, so click <b>Image</b> then 
    point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>Levels...</b></li>
	<li><b>Drag</b> the sliders so they are in approximately the same position as those 
    in the image below...<br>
	<img border="0" src="12/1206.jpg"><br>Don't try to make your sliders match mine exactly (your sun is different from 
    mine), instead move them to a 
    position that gives your sun a nice, unique pattern and a glow that you like</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
	<li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Sharpen</b> and click <b>Unsharp 
    Mask...</b> <br><img border="0" src="12/1231.jpg"><br>Despite its name, the Unsharp Mask Filter actually makes the image 
    sharper.....go figure.....</li>
	<li>Set the values to match those in the image below...<br>
	<img border="0" src="12/1207.jpg"><br>You will have to type the Amount is as 
	the slider only goes up to 200%</li>
  </ol>
<p>Notice that you now have a more detailed and interesting surface.</p>
<ol start="17">
	<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
	<li>The sun looks flat, so let's give it a more spherical look - click <b>Filter</b> then point at
    <b>Distort</b> and click <span class="style1"><b>Spherize</b> (this filter causes the selection to seem as though it is round)<font color="#000000">...</font><br>
	</span><img border="0" src="12/1213.jpg" width="391" height="517"></li>
	<li>Set the Amount to <b>100</b>%...<br>
	<img border="0" src="12/1208.jpg"></li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
	<li>Take a look at your sun and determine if you are happy with how 
    spherical it looks; if not, repeat the Spherize, but turn down the Amount 
    (most of you will want this second Spherize to have an Amount of 50%) - 
    when you are happy with how spherical it looks, move on...<br>
	<img border="0" src="12/1209.jpg" width="266" height="259"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>To give you an idea of the changes we just made, in the image below, the sun 
  on the left is what I had after direction 14 while the one on the right is 
  after applying the Unsharp Mask and Spherize filters...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1210.jpg" width="499" height="254"></p>
<p align="left">
    Notice how the sun on the right looks waaaaay cooler and rounder. And here 
    is the really interesting part - despite the two suns being the exact same 
    size in the image above, the sun on the right appears to be slightly smaller 
    because it seems to be bulging out towards you. I know, awesome. Ok, let's 
    add some color.</p>
<ol start="22">
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> and point at <b>
    Adjustments</b> and click <b>Color Balance</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1211.jpg"><br>
	We will need to change 
    each of the three Range settings shown below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1232.jpg" width="159" height="185"><br>
    You need to change each value separately</li>
  </ol>
<p>Keep in mind that since 
    everyone's sun pattern is different, you do not have to use the exact 
    numbers indicated in the next 6 directions. Instead, use them as the starting 
    point and make minor adjustments to the various values until you get a nice, 
    bright sun with a pattern you are happy with.</p>
<ol start="23">
    <li>Make sure the <b>Range</b> selection is set to <b>Shadows</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1234.jpg" width="181" height="51"></li>
	<li>Change the <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, and <b>Blue</b> color settings to match the image 
    below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1236.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Change the <b>Range</b> selection to <b>Midtones</b>...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1212.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Change the <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, and <b>Blue</b> color settings to match the image 
    below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1214.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Change the <b>Range</b> selection to <b>Highlights</b>...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1238.jpg" width="180" height="50" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Change the <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, and <b>Blue</b> color settings to match the 
    image below...<br>

    <img border="0" src="12/1239.jpg" width="362" height="197" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>You should now have a sun similar to the one below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1215.jpg" width="265" height="259" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">Remember that what we are making is the image of a sun if you were looking 
    at it without the incredible glow around it, otherwise we could just make a 
    really large star using the Burn Tool, but that would be a sun with no 
    character, and where is the fun in that?</p>
<ol start="29">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> on the Color Balance window</li>
  </ol>
  Because the original circle that we drew was an ordinary circle with a 
    hard edge, most of us now have a sharp edge that will make our sun stand out 
in our scene instead of blend in with the surrounding space, so 
    let's soften up the edge just a little bit. There are several ways to pull 
this off using Photopea, so let's use a method that will give us a quick 
introduction to Masks.<ol start="30">
  <li>Make sure your sun is selected (if it is not, reread the 
    <a href="#important">important directions</a> at the top of this page)</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to start by decreasing the selection by several pixels so that we can 
feather the edge.</p>
<ol start="31">
  <li>Click <b>Select</b> then click <b>Modify</b> and click <b>Contract</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1216.jpg" width="395" height="433" align="middle"><br>
	This will open the Contract window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1217.jpg" width="259" height="167" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Set the <b>Contract</b> amount to <b>1</b> px as in the above image</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b> - notice that the selection line around our sun is now 
	slightly smaller...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1218.jpg" width="615" height="140" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's apply a feather to our selection.</p>
<ol start="34">
  <li>Click <b>Select</b> then point at <b>Modify</b> and click <b>Feather</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1219.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	This will open the Feather window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1220.jpg" width="262" height="163" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Set the <b>Feather</b> amount to <b>3</b> px as in the image above</li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b> - notice that nothing appears to have happened</li>
</ol>
<p>Ummmm.....nothing happened.....what's going on? It turns out that the 
feather we just applied was only applied to the SELECTION and not to the sun 
image itself. If we were to fill the selection with a color at this point, it 
would have a nice, 3 pixel wide feather around it. What we need now is a way to 
apply the feathering that is on our selection onto the actual image of the sun 
itself. This is where a Mask will come in handy.</p>
<ol start="37">
  <li>At the bottom of the Layers panel, click the <b>Add Raster Mask</b> 
	icon...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1221.jpg" width="302" height="104" align="middle"><br>
	Notice when you click the icon that the sun immediately gets a softer edge<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1235.jpg" width="429" height="136" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
  <p>So what is going on? Masks sit on layers and control the transparency (how 
	visible) the items on the layer are. With our mask, we are telling Photopea 
	to allow color from lower layers to appear through the feathered edge of our 
	selection. Take a look at your Layers panel...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1233.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p>That black square with the white circle in it is there to indicate that the 
layer has a mask applied to it. Black areas of a layer mask are see through 
while white areas are solid. In other words, we can see what is on the layers 
below our sun in the black area, and we can see what is on the sun layer in the 
white area. Turn the visibility of your Star Field folder group on to get the full 
effect...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1222.jpg" width="437" height="164" align="middle"></p>
<ol start="38">
    <li>Turn the <b>visibility</b> of your Nebula folder group on - you should 
    have something like the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1223.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our sun is looking pretty good at this point, but we still need to give it 
  a corona (the glowing part just above the surface of the sun)</p>
<ol start="39">
    <li><span class="style1"><b>Double-click</b> the Sun layer</span> where 
    indicated below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1237.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    <span class="style1">This opens the Layer Style window</span>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1224.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click the <b>Outer Glow</b> option (red arrow above)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Be careful when working with the Layer Style window. You will only see the 
  settings for each option if that option is highlighted in gray, as Outer Glow 
  is above. Note that it is possible to turn options on and off by clicking the 
  checkbox without actually selecting the option, so be sure that you have each 
  option selected - it should be gray - before you try to adjust its settings.</p>
<ol start="41">
    <li>We only need to make a few changes here: change the <b>color</b> to a 
    light orange, and increase the <b>Size</b> option to 75...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1225.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>You should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1226.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to place your sun in a corner of your space scene - it 
    doesn't matter which corner you put it in, but be sure that what is showing 
    has more bright areas than dark (keep in mind that if you want it in a 
    specific corner but don't like the part of the sun showing on that corner 
    that you can always rotate the sun [click <b>Edit</b> - <b>Transform</b> - 
    <b>Rotate</b>]<b> </b>until an area that you like is visible)</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your sun (<i>remember to hold down the <b>Shift</b> key as you resize your 
    sun so that you are changing the height and width at the same time</i>) to make 
    it the 
    size you would like it to be - remember, this is your sun so it needs to be 
    large, but how large is up to you (don't make it too large or too small as 
    it will look unnatural)</li>
    <li>Click the <b>New Folder</b> icon at the bottom of the Layers panel, this 
	will insert a new folder at the top of your layer stack...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1227.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Don't worry if your folder is named something different than mine - we will 
	change the folder name a few directions from now</li>
  </ol>
<p>Notice that the Sun layer is not in the new folder even though it was the 
active layer when we inserted the new folder. Photopea only places layers into a 
new folder when the folder is created if multiple layers are selected. We can 
tell that the Sun layer is outside the new folder because the layer thumbnail of 
the Sun layer and the black arrow of the folder are aligned with each other. If 
the Sun layer was inside the folder, it would be indented. Keep working and you 
will see what I mean a few directions from now.</p>
<p>Let's place the Sun layer in the new folder.</p>
<ol start="47">
    <li>Click the Sun layer and drag it up until you see a <b>black box</b> 
	around the new folder...<b><br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="12/1240.jpg" width="355" height="192" align="middle"><br>
	This indicates that if we release the Sun layer that it will be placed in 
	the folder</li>
	<li>Release the the mouse button - the Sun layer is now in the folder...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1241.jpg" width="303" height="174" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
<p>We can tell that the Sun layer is inside the folder because the Sun layer's 
thumbnail is indented slightly to the right. Notice how it no longer sits 
directly under the black arrow of the folder.</p>
<ol start="49">
    <li><b>Rename</b> the folder containing the Sun layer to <b>Sun</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1242.jpg" width="302" height="165" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Collapse the Sun folder by clicking the black arrow...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1243.jpg" width="302" height="165" align="middle"><br>
	Your Layers panel should now look like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="12/1244.jpg" width="303" height="120" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Sun folder group</li>
  </ol>
  You should now have something similar to the image below - notice that I 
    flipped my sun around so that what is mostly visible is the brightest 
    portion...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="12/1228.jpg" width="500" height="501" align="middle"></p>
  <p>We are now ready to add some planets to our space scene. We will make two 
  different planets using similar procedures, with one requiring you to use an 
  existing image and the other allowing you to build the planet entirely from 
  scratch. I know...awesome.</p>
