<p>We are going to take our blue image and begin to draw on top of it with black 
ink to create our character. When you start to ink your image, you may want the 
picture to 
disappear and reappear at your command to check how it looks without having to 
delete it. Layers are good for this. Layers are good for many things. Layers are  our friends.</p>
<p>
There should be a Layers panel 
like the one shown below on the right side of your Photopea screen...</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="04/401.jpg"></p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure Photopea is running and you have your <b>
  Face03</b> file open</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic idea behind layers is that you can have many different elements to the picture you're 
working on stored on different layers. To help better understand this, imagine a stack of 
clear plastic sheets with each 
sheet containing just one piece of an image. For example, the top sheet has a hat, the next sheet has a 
shirt, and the third sheet has a human head. Since each piece is on its own 
sheet, we can view each item separately, or if we stack all of the sheets on top 
of each other...</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="04/403.jpg" width="373" height="299"></p>
<p>we see the image of a person wearing a shirt and hat. The beauty of 
this system is that you can pull out any individual sheet and work only on it without 
bothering the rest of the sheets - for example, I can pull out the sheet 
with the shirt on it and make the shirt a different color without changing the 
other sheets. This is how layers work. Layers can be moved around or turned 
visible and invisible without impacting other parts of the image. Layers are our 
friends.</p>
<p>We don't want to 
make any additional changes to our blue image layer, so let's lock 
out changes to it. First, 
  notice that our only layer is labeled as Backgroud...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="04/404.jpg"></p>
<p>Our initial layer is named Background as a way to remind us that it was the 
original layer in this image. Unlike Photoshop, there is no difference between 
regular layer and Background layers. But just like Photoshop, we can use the 
Layer panel's Lock function to turn off the ability to edit the contents of a 
layer.</p>
<p>Let's rename our layer to something a little more appropriate and lock it so 
that we cannot accidentally make changes to it.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Double-click on the Background layer name - this will cause Photopea to enter 
  layer rename mode...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/406.jpg" width="300" height="105"><br>
	If double-clicking opens a large Layer Style window, that means you missed 
	the word Background when you double-clicked - simply click the X to close 
	the Layer Style window and try to double-click the word Background again</li>
  <li>Change the layer name to <b>Face</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/407.jpg"></li>
  <li>Press Enter - 
  your Layers panel should now look like this...<b><br>
  </b>
  <font color="#800000">
  <img border="0" src="04/408.jpg"></font></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that we don't want to do anything to our Face layer at this point, so let's lock it down.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>With the <b>Face</b> layer still selected (it should be 
  highlighted in gray just like the image above), click the <b>Lock all</b> 
  icon...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/409.jpg"><br>
  Notice that a black lock appears on the Face layer...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/410.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>This black lock indicates that our layer is now locked to editing. We can 
still do things like move the layer up and down in the layer stack (more on 
moving layers around later), but we are now unable to to make any changes to the 
contents of this layer until we turn the lock off. </p>
<p>Let's take a quick second to look at the other lock possibilities in Photopea...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="04/402.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's leave the layer locked for now and create the other 
three layers we will 
need for this tutorial. We are going to need one layer to draw the main lines of our cartoon 
(and fill it with color), another to hold the lines we will draw freehand, and a 
final one to fill in our line color.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>At the bottom of the Layers panel, click the <b>New Layer</b> icon...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/411.jpg"><br>
	Your Layer panel should now look like this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/414.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the new layer was placed above our Face layer. Any time we insert a 
new layer in Photopea it is placed above the current active layer by default.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>Change the layer name from <b>Layer 1</b> to <b>
  Cartoon</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/412.jpg"><br>
	Your Layers panel should now look 
  like this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="04/413.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>
<font color="#111111">Notice that the Cartoon layer is unlocked (this happens </font>
<font color="#FF0000">automatically, or by default</font><font color="#111111">) 
and is now the active layer, which means if we were to make changes to our image 
at this point that those changes would only show up on the Cartoon layer. </font></p>
<p align="center">
<b><font size="5">Always remember that </font>
<font size="5" color="#FF0000">the layer you are working on is the one that is
</font><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0"><font color="#FF0000" size="6">
highlighted in gray</font></span><font color="#800000" size="5">.</font></b></p>
<p>
If you ever edit your image and don't see the changes you made, be 
sure to check what layer you're working with because most actions are only applied 
to a single layer.</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>Use the New Layer method described in the last <b>2 directions</b> to create 
  an additional layer named <b>Backing - </b>your Layers panel should now look like this...<br>
<img src="04/415.jpg" width="253" height="206"></li>
  <li>Lock the <b>Backing</b> layer - your Layers panel 
  should now look like this...<br>
<img src="04/416.jpg" width="256" height="199"><br>
  Just so you know, we won't actually place content on the Backing layer until 
  <a href="step08.html">Step 08</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the layer icons (the tiny pictures between the eye graphic and the 
layer name in the image above) for both the Cartoon and Backing layers are a 
tiny checkerboard pattern...</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="04/417.jpg" width="145" height="136"></p>
<p> 
<span class="style2">This is 
Photopea's way of indicating that something is
 
<b>transparent</b></span>. In other words, both the Cartoon and Backing layers 
are empty. In fact, if we turn the visibility of the Face layer off (so that all 
layers are invisible) we will see that the checkerboard pattern covers our 
canvas.&nbsp;<a name="eye"></a>Take a look at the left edge of your Layers 
panel and locate the tiny <span class="style2"> 
<b>eye</b> for each layer (if you don't see them, refer to the graphic below)...</span></p>
<p align="center"> 
<img src="04/418.jpg" width="241" height="221"></p>
<p> 
<span class="style2"> 
This allows 
you to turn the visibility (whether you can see that layer or not) of the layer on and off</span>. 
If the eye is there then the layer is turned on and you can see it. Clicking the 
eye to remove it will make that layer invisible. Note that the layer does not 
vanish completely, it's just invisible. Clicking the eye again will bring it 
back.</p>
<ol start="10">
  <li>Click the <b>layer visibility icon</b> (the little 
  eye) for the Face layer (pointed at with the red arrow above) to turn it off - 
  notice that your image is now a huge 
  checkerboard - remember that checkerboard means transparent</li>
  <li>Click the <b>layer visibility icon</b> for the Face 
  layer again to 
  turn it back on</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next step we are going to begin creating the outline of our cartoon 
face, so let's make a quick adjustment to our layers so that the Cartoon layer, 
which we will be using in the next 3 steps, is at the top of our layer stack.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>Click the <b>Backing </b>layer and drag it <b>down</b> 
  until you see a dark line appear beneath the Cartoon layer...<br>
<img src="04/419.jpg" width="300" height="218"><br>
  and release the mouse 
  button - your Layers panel should now look like this...<br>
<img src="04/420.jpg" width="269" height="224"></li>
</ol>
<p>We need one additional layer to hold the freehand line we will draw in
<a href="step06.html">Step 06</a>.</p>
<ol start="13">
  <li>Insert a new layer named <b>Freehand</b> and lock it - your Layers panel 
  should now look like this...<br>
<img src="04/421.jpg" width="252" height="246"></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the Freehand layer is above the Backing layer, which was the 
active layer when you inserted the Freehand layer in the last direction. Instead 
of placing this new layer at the top of the layer stack (above the Cartoon 
layer), Photopea inserted it above the currently active layer. This is a 
default action for Photopea, so if you want to insert a new layer at the top of 
your layer stack always be sure you have the topmost layer selected when you 
insert it.</p>
<p>When we get to <a href="step06.html">Step 06</a>, we will want the Freehand 
layer to be at the top of the layer stack, so let's go ahead and move it there 
now. Fortunately for us, there is a quick and easy keyboard shortcut that will 
move a layer to the top of the stack.</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li>With the Freehand layer selected, press <font color="#FF0000"> <b>Shift+Ctrl+]</b></font> and the 
  Freehand layer should <font color="#FF0000">jump to the top so that your layer stack</font> looks like 
  this...<br>
<img src="04/422.jpg" width="239" height="231"></li>
</ol>
<p>We are now ready to begin Inking our character.</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">
	Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save as PSD</b></font></li>
	<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">
	Name the file <b>Face04</b> (Face because it is the face file, and 04 because 
	this is Step 04)</font></li>
</ol>
