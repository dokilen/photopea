<p>OK, let's put your head aside and use some new tools to create an amazing, 
dazzling space panorama.</p>


<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind as you work through the remaining Steps 
of this tutorial:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Since we have already discussed what many tools 
    do and why we are using them, these directions will not go into detail about 
    any tool we have already used (if you can't remember what a tool does or why we are using it, 
    go back to the step it was covered and refresh your memory)</li>
    <li>Continue to take notes and work 
    through the directions step-by-step</li>
    <li>Once a technique has been described it will not be described in future 
    steps that use it - you will have to actually remember how to do it</li>
    <li>Your image <b>WILL NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES 
    THAT ARE SHOWN AS EXAMPLES IN THE TUTORIALS</b> - this is ok and is actually 
    what is supposed to happen; your stuff is supposed to be different and 
    unique</li>
    <li>The directions are in the order they are in on purpose - work 
    the steps in this order to make sure everything comes out like it should</li>
    <li>There are usually several different ways to do everything in Photopea, 
    and we will generally cover only one way to accomplish each task, and not 
    always the easiest way - keep in mind that we are interested in learning as 
    many of the tools as we can so we can use them in a variety of situations in 
    the future</li>
    <li>Save your work often as
    <b>Space</b> followed by the Step number (you will be reminded of this as 
	the end of each Step)</li>
    <li>Your space scene will be a <b>LARGE</b>, complicated 
    file when you are finished - work through the steps <b>CAREFULLY</b> and read 
    all of the <b>DIRECTIONS</b>!</li>
</ul>
  <p>Follow along with the directions and you should end up with an amazing 
  image. We need to start a new document that is large enough to fit everything we 
  are going to be doing in this part of the project.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you still have your Face file open go ahead and close it now - we 
    will not need it again until <a href="step19.html">Step 19</a></li>
    <li>Open <b>Photopea</b> and click <b>File</b> then <b>New...</b> to begin a new document</li>
    <li>We want a large image, so change the settings to the following...<br>
    <img border="0" src="09/901.jpg" width="354" height="239"><br>
    Be sure that all 5 of your settings <b>exactly</b> match those above as they are very important; 
    for example, <span class="style3">by choosing Transparent for <strong>Background Contents</strong> we will avoid 
    having to remove the default white background </span>that we will not need 
	for our project</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Be certain your Width and Height are set to px (which is pixels - the red arrow above) and <b>NOT</b> Inches (or any 
  other setting). If you make a 1000 inch square image you are creating a 
  graphic that is over 83 <i>FEET</i> wide. Yeah, that will crash Photopea, your 
	computer, the Internet, and probably every computer network around the 
	world. Ok, just kidding, but you will kill Photopea. Just make sure it says 
	px.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Click <b>Create</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="times new roman">
  Photopea should open a new blank image and name it <font color="#FF0000">
	Space09. Note that if we had not put in a Name that Photopea would have 
	named our image New Project. This is 
actually a very common name for Photopea images as this is the default name 
given to all new images created in Photopea and  will remain the image's 
name unless you change it.</font></font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman">

<ol start="5">
  <li>Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save as PSD</b></li>
	<li>Name the file <b>Space09</b></li>
</ol>
</font>
  <table width="100%" height="27" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#111111" bgcolor="#FFFFCC" style="border-collapse: collapse">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" height="27"><font face="Times New Roman">
        <div align="center"><font size="4"><b>READ THE DIRECTIONS</b>! You can 
          <b>ONLY</b> get credit for
        doing  the work if you read and follow the directions <b>YOURSELF</b>!!</font></div></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Our first step in creating an amazing space panorama is to create a field 
  of stars.</p>
