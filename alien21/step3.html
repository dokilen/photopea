  <p>You could easily turn yourself green by using the 
  Adjustment tools, but doing so will cause everything in the entire image to be tinted a different color and we really only want our skin 
  and hair to change color and not the background. We will use a tool to select only the things we 
  want to turn green: Quick Mask. Using Quick Mask, we can actually 
  draw on our image with a brush and then have Photopea turn what we drew into 
  a selection. I know, cool huh?<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Click the Brush Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image002.jpg"></li>
  <li>
  <p>Choose the Hard Mechanical brush...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image004.jpg"></li>
  <li>
  <p>Make sure the Opacity and Flow are set to 100% in the Brush 
  Tool options bar...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image006.jpg"></li>
  <li>
  <p>Set the brush size to 100 (remember that you can use the ] key to increase 
	the brush size until it reads 100...)<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/12.jpg" width="101" height="57"></li>
	<li>
  <p>Click the Quick Mask Mode icon at the bottom left of the Photopea window...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/08.jpg"><br>
	When active, the icon should look like this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/07.jpg" width="79" height="86"></li>
</ol>
  <p>It may appear as though nothing 
  is different, but you are in fact now in Quick Mask mode. Photopea doesn't 
	really give us any other way to know that we are in Quick Mask mode other 
	than the icon appearing selected. However, once we begin to draw what is 
	going on will be obvious.<ol start="6">
  <li>
  <p>Begin coloring your skin - do only skin at this 
  point – notice that while in Quick Mask mode 
  that Photopea colors your subject red...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image008.jpg" width="202" height="122"><br>
  Don’t freak out, this is what we want – color in all parts of your  
  skin 
  including the head and neck and chest and shoulders and any other 
  skin that is showing</li>
  <li>
  <p>Fill in as much of your skin as you can with the 
  larger brush, then decrease the brush size (remember the </font>
<Font face="Tahoma">

  [</font><Font face="Times New Roman">

  and </font>
<Font face="Tahoma">

  ]</font><Font face="Times New Roman">

  keys) and fill in the smaller areas until you have all of your skin in red...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image011.jpg" width="202" height="213"><br>
  Keep in mind that if you color outside your skin that you can use the Eraser 
	Tool to remove the excess red (notice in the image above that hair and teeth are not included)</font></li>
</ol>
  <p><Font face="Times New Roman">Don't worry, you are not actually coloring 
	anything red. While in Quick Mask mode, the red areas are how you tell 
	Photopea what you want to turn into a selection and what you want to leave 
	out. Don't worry if your red color is darker than mine, I turned the Opacity 
	of mine down a little bit so you could see his facial features through the 
	red color a little 
	better.</font><hr><p><font face="Times New Roman">Now you have a choice to make: you can stop 
  Quick Masking at this point and turn only your skin green, or you can continue 
  masking and color in your entire body including your hair and teeth so that 
  you have this...</font><p align="center"><Font face="Times New Roman">
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image010.jpg" width="187" height="202"></font><Font face="Times New Roman"><p>
You can leave your hair and teeth their natural color or you can turn them green -
what you do is up to you. I'm going to turn my entire person green, so the 
rest of the directions will be using the selection you see in the image directly 
above. To see examples of both green and natural hair and teeth refer back to
<a href="step1.html#aliens">Step 1</a>:<ul>
	<li>Mrs. Walker [the first alien] has green 
hair but natural lips and teeth</li>
	<li>Al Gore's hair [the second alien] is his natural color</li>
	<li>Adam [the third alien] has natural hair and green teeth</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make your decision now and continue accordingly. You can even turn your 
	hair a different color if you like - Ms. McRee's (the 
fourth alien) purple hair is an example of this. It's all up to you.</p>
	<ol start="8">
  <li>
  <p>Press the Q key to exit Quick Mask mode - notice that you now have a 
	selection...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/14.jpg" width="186" height="217"></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you may notice a slight problem - it appears that everything 
EXCEPT the red area is selected. You're right! Quick Mask actually allows us to 
indicated the areas of an image that we do not want to mess around with. This is 
great, but for what we are doing it is much easier to color in the part we want 
to keep and then flip the selected area so that our face is selected. Inverting 
the selection area is easy.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>
  <p>On the Menu bar, click Select and then click Inverse...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/15.jpg" width="222" height="137"><br>
	You should now have only your big bulbous head (or just your face if that is 
	what you want) selected...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image014.jpg" width="181" height="213"></li>
</ol>
  <p>At this point, there will be areas of your image that need to be fine 
  tuned. Follow the directions below to make adjustments. TAKE THE TIME TO GET YOUR SELECTION RIGHT!!!! A large part of your grade on 
  this project is based on how accurate you are with the selection tools - DO 
  NOT simply make a crappy selection and turn it green, instead take the time to 
  do a good job (take pride in your work!).<ol start="10">
  <li>Zoom way in on your selection...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/01.jpg" width="360" height="213"></li>
  <li>Click the Lasso Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image016.jpg"></li>
  <li>Work your way around the edge of your selection to add or remove areas as 
  necessary:<uL>
  <li>Press and hold the Shift key and then click and drag the 
    Lasso Tool to draw a circle around areas you wish to add to your selection</li>
  <li>Press and hold the Alt key and then click and drag the Lasso Tool to 
  draw a circle around areas you wish to delete from your selection</li></ul>
      
</ol>
  <p>When you have a selection you are happy with, it is time to turn your skin 
  green.</p>
<ol start="13">
    <li>
  <p>Press Ctrl+U on the keyboard to open the Hue/Saturation window...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image018.jpg"></li>
  <li>
  <p>Drag the Hue slider to the right until you a get a 
  color you like – keep in mind that you can adjust the Saturation and Lightness as well to get a color that 
  you are happy with...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/image020.jpg" width="202" height="255"><br>
  To create the above color, I used a Hue of 80 and a Saturation of -15...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/10.jpg"><br>
  Because you are working with a different image than mine, your numbers will be different 
	- this is OK, just drag the sliders until you 
  have a nice shade of green</li>
  <li>
  <p>Click OK</li>
  <li>
  <p>Press Ctrl+D on the keyboard to deselect your image</li>

</ol>
  <p>Some of you may notice at this point that some regions of your image have a 
  hard, unnatural edge. Take a look at the image below...<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/02.jpg" width="465" height="422"><p>Notice 
that while some parts have a slight blur to them so that they appear to blend in 
with the image, that the areas pointed at with the red arrows have a definite 
edge. We can easily fix this with the Blur Tool.<ol start="17">
  <li>Click the Blur Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/03.jpg"><br>
  If you can not see the Blur Tool, it is on the same button as the Sharpen and 
  Smudge tools...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/11.jpg"></li>
  <li>In the Blur Tool options bar, set the Brush to Hard Mechanical,
  set the Size to 15, 
  and set the Strength: (how blurry Photopea makes the image each time you 
  click) to 50%...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/04.jpg"><br>
  Feel free to decrease the size of the brush in any spots you need to so that 
  you are not blurring important parts of the image</li>
  <li>Click on your image in any place where you have a hard edge - DO 
  NOT click and drag, instead click in one spot and then release the mouse 
  button and move to the next spot and repeat...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step3_files/05.jpg" width="931" height="422"><br>
  Notice that the difference is not huge, but when you zoom out and view the 
	entire image it should make everything look more realistic and not be so 
	obvious that it is an image you messed around with</li>
  <li>Go around the entire image and repeat the above process until all of your 
  edges look blended</li>
  </ol>
<p>DON'T GO CRAZY with the Blur Tool! Remember that you are simply blending 
things together to make them look more realistic. If you blur your image too 
much, it will simply look bad (which means lower grade!). We want our image to 
look as realistic as possible. Yes, we are creating an alien, but we want it to 
look like a realistic alien.</p>
<ol start="21">
  <li>Save your work in your Alien folder</li>
  </ol>
<p>Now that you are green, let's get your eyes looking a little more alien.</p>
