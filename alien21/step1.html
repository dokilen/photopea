<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">For this Photopea project, we will be 
going beyond the basic tools and using some new, 
interesting, useful, and very powerful Photopea tools. We are going to turn a normal photo of you into 
a freaky photo of an alien. We will be working with a headshot (selfie) of you 
as the main image with the goal of getting some practice using a quick mask and 
learning how to use the Liquify filter, 
which is very cool. When you have completed this assignment, you 
should have an awesome alien head. Smile - this is fun.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#800000"><b>A word of caution:</b></font> 
This project assumes that you have experience with Photopea, so this short lesson should only take you two or three days to complete. 
Note that these directions will not cover <i>every single</i> step and tell you how to do <i>every 
single</i> thing, though it will discuss some tools and techniques in detail. If these instructions refer to something but do not discuss it in depth 
and you do not understand, it is your 
responsibility to look further at the issue to figure it out. Take pride in your work and attempt to 
solve your own problems - you will enjoy this process much more if you are doing 
the work yourself.</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a folder on your device named Alien - you will save all work for 
	this project in that folder</li>
	<li>Go to photopea.com</li>
  <li>Click File and then click Open</li>
  <li>You will need a headshot image for this project, so either find an 
	existing image of you or take a new one</li>
</ol>
<p>This project is easiest when the headshot picture you are using is pretty 
straight on, but just about any picture will work. Also, the more simple the 
background the better. This process tends to create curves and distortions in 
the background that have to be corrected for our image to look realistic, so 
again the more simple the background the better.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Go to the location on your device where your headshot photo is saved and 
	double-click it to open it up in Photopea</li>
  <li>We need the image to be a Photopea file, so 
  click File and then Save As... and save the image as Alien.psd on your device 
	(remember where you save it so you can submit on the due date)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's adjust your image so that everyone's image is the same size (this will 
make the instructions applicable to everyone).</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>Click Image then click Image Size...</li>
  <li>Make sure the Keep Aspect Ratio icon is activated...<br>
<img border="0" src="step1_files/11.jpg"></li>
  <li>Check to make sure Dimensions is set to Pixels...<br>
<img border="0" src="step1_files/12.jpg"></li>
  <li>Set the Width to 1000 pixels - with Constrain Aspect Ratio activated, the 
  height should resize itself automatically - let it...<br>
<img border="0" src="step1_files/13.jpg"></li>
  <li>Click OK</li>
  <li>Save your image to your Alien folder</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the image I will be using for these 
directions...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="step1_files/image002.jpg" width="202" height="255"></p>
<p align="left">
Please don't make any political assumptions here - I'm only using this 
image because he was President when I wrote the first version of these 
instructions.</p>
<p>At this point, our file is set up and ready to go. In Step 2 we will reshape your head into something a little more alien-like. 
In the steps that follow, we will turn you green, give you some alien eyes, and 
even add in a tail.</p>
<hr>
<p>Right about now you are probably wondering just what you will eventually look 
like. Below are some example aliens for you to check out...</p>
