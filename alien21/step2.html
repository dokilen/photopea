<p>The first thing we need to do is give ourselves a nice, big alien head. For 
this we will need the Liquify filter.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Duplicate the original layer (which should be named Background) by 
  right-clicking the layer name and choosing Duplicate Layer</li>
</ol>
<p>We will need the original layer on Step 6.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Rename the new layer to Alien (it should be at the top of the layer stack)</li>
  <li>Make sure the Alien layer is selected</li>
  <li>Click Filter and then click Liquify to open the Liquify window</li>
	<li>If you can't see all of your image in the Liquify window, roll the 
	mouse wheel down until you can see your entire head</li>
  <li>Select the Blow Tool on the left side of the Liquify window...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image008.jpg"></li>
  <li>On the right side, set Rate to 80...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image004.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<p>Rate controls the speed at which our face is distorted by the Liquify tools - 
the higher the number the quicker the distortion. Since we are new to the 
Liquify tools, 80 is a good amount to use as it will prevent Photopea from 
making changes too fast, but won't go so slow that we get frustrated.</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>Press the
<font face="Tahoma">

  ]</font>

  key on the keyboard repeatedly to increase the brush size until your brush 
  circle is just large enough to fit your head...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image006.jpg" width="200" height="217"><br>
  Note that pressing and holding the ] key will cause the size of the 
  brush to increase gradually, while pressing the
<font face="Tahoma">

  [</font> key on the keyboard will decrease the brush size</li>
  <li>Click in the middle of your forehead and hold down the left mouse button to 
  grow your head...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image010.jpg" width="200" height="225"><br>
  Don't make it too large or it will just look ridiculous</li>
  <li>Now click on the left temple and grow your head some more...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image012.jpg" width="200" height="218"><img border="0" src="step2_files/image014.jpg" width="200" height="218"></li>
  <li>Now repeat the process on the right temple...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image016.jpg" width="188" height="218"></li>
</ol>
<p>Don't worry if you can't get your head to look exactly right or if it doesn't 
look as good as mine. This is your first time using this tool, and it may take a 
while for you to be really proficient with it. Remember that our goal here is to 
be introduced to this tool and what it can do, not to become an expert with it 
overnight. Just get your head to a nice shape you can live with and move on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Aliens usually have tiny mouths and chins, so let's use another feature of 
the Liquify window to reduce the size of the chin.</p>
</font>
<ol start="12">
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <li>Click the Shrink Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image018.jpg"><br>
  Note that the Shrink Tool is the opposite of the Blow Tool</li>
  <li>Decrease the size of your brush (remember the keyboard shortcut to change 
	the size of the brush? Hope so cause I'm not going to tell you here) so that it covers just your face (eyes, 
  nose, mouth, and chin)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/29.jpg" width="188" height="218"></li>
</ol>
<p>A quick hint: in reality, what size you make your brush at this point is up to you. 
Just choose 
  a size and then do the following steps and determine if you like the results or 
  not. If you don't, remember that you can always use Ctrl+Z or go into the 
  History panel to undo the shrink 
  then change the size of your brush and reshrink your face until you get 
  something that you like.</p>
</font>
<ol start="14">
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <li>Place the center of the circle on your 
  chin</li>
  <li>Press and hold the left mouse button until you have a nicely shaped tiny 
  alien chin...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image020.jpg" width="200" height="216"></li>
  <li>Decrease the size of your brush slightly (again, exactly what size 
  you make it is up to you) and repeat the shrink process on your ears, nose, 
  and mouth - if you can't see enough of your ears to be able to work with them 
  then just ignore them...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image022.jpg" width="200" height="221"></li>
</ol>
<p>Our next job is turn our thin human eyes into large alien eyes. We will 
return to the Blow Tool for this.</p>
</font>
<ol start="17">
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <li>Select the Blow Tool</li>
  <li>Adjust the size of your brush so that it is just wide enough to cover both 
  eyes</li>
  <li>Click in the middle of your left eye to enlarge it - don't go crazy with your 
  size, look at the image below and the examples at the end of Step 1 to get an 
  idea of a good eye size</li>
  <li>Still using your left eye, click and enlarge the left 
  side of the eye</li>
  <li>Still using your left eye, click and enlarge the 
  right side of the eye</li>
  <li>Repeat the process to enlarge your right eye - you should end up with nice, 
  large alien eyes...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image024.jpg" width="200" height="227"></li>
</ol>
<p>If your eyes do not have the large alien look they should and instead look  rather flattened, it 
is likely that you were squinting or that the 
  natural shape of your eyes just doesn't work well with the above process (this 
is fine - not everyone's face works well as an alien). Try 
  further shaping your eye by reducing the size of your brush so that it is just 
  wide enough to cover one eye then click and enlarge in the middle of each eye 
  - this should give you the nice bulging, alien eyes we are looking for (but 
  again, don't go crazy or it will just look bad). Don't worry too much about 
how the pupil or sclera looks at this point as we will be adjusting the coloring 
of the eyes in Step 4.</p><hr>
</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">

<p>You should be looking pretty alien by now, so we only need a few simple 
adjustments to complete the head. Let's give the mouth a nice smile. For this we 
will use the Smudge tool. This tool allows 
us to click and drag areas of our image to reposition them. For example, we can 
drag the very tip of our chin down, or give ourselves pointed ears, or make any other 
similar small adjustment.</p>
</font>
<ol start="23">
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <li>Select the Smudge Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="step2_files/image026.jpg"></li>
<li>Change&nbsp;the brush size so that it is just large enough to cover the mouth 
then&nbsp;click and drag&nbsp;the corners of the mouth up</li>
<li>Now&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the size of the brush slightly and&nbsp;drag&nbsp;the tip of the chin 
down just a little</li>
<li>Now decrease the size of the brush and give your subject pointed ears (if 
you can)</li>
<li>Use the&nbsp;Smudge Tool&nbsp;to make any other adjustments you would like to make 
(don't go crazy with it!) - your character should now have a distinct alien 
look…<br>
<img border="0" src="step2_files/image028.jpg" width="202" height="255"></li>
</ol>
<p>Be careful not to go crazy with the Smudge Tool. While it is a great tool to 
make specific adjustments to make your alien head look unique, if overused it 
becomes obvious that we are manipulating our image with Photopea.</p>
<ol start="28">
  <li>Click OK on the right side to exit the Liquify window</li>
  <li>Save your work in your Alien folder</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have an alien head, let's turn ourselves green.</p>
