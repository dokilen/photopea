  <p>We will be creating 
  our second planet completely from scratch. This is a lengthy step with lots of 
  directions, so read the directions carefully and follow along as we will cover 
  lots of great Photopea tools and techniques. The planet we are going to 
  create will resemble the planet Saturn, 
  complete with an awesome set of rings, but will have colorful bands of gas like Jupiter. 
  Yeah, I know, I can't wait to get started either.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>ONE MORE QUICK REMINDER THAT IS A VERY LONG STEP. <br>
IF YOU NEED TO STOP AND COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME, SIMPLY USE File &gt; Save 
as PSD TO SAVE YOUR WORK.</b></font></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space13</b> file in Photopea</li>
    <li>Turn <b>off</b> the visibility of all of your current layer folders (you should see 
    the checkerboard)</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer and name it <b>Planet2</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14991.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Ellipse Select Tool</b></li>
</ol>
  <p>The first thing we need is a circle that will serve as the shape of our 
	planet. For 
  everything to work correctly, we are all going to have to use the same sized 
  circle, so let's first make sure everyone is using the same measurements.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> and then click <b>Preferences</b> (near the bottom of 
	the edit menu)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1401.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	This will open the Preferences window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14901.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click the drop-down selection arrow next to <b>Ruler Units</b>  
    and select <b>Pixels</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1402.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    If Pixels is already selected then leave it alone</li>
    <li>Click the <b>X</b> to close the Preferences window</li>
    <li><b>Place</b> your cursor near the upper left hand corner of your image 
    (but do not place it on the very corner or you will have problems later)...<br>
	<img border="0" src="14/1403.jpg" width="187" height="78" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then <b>click and drag</b> down and to 
    the right until you have created an <b>800 pixel Wide x 800 pixel High</b> circle...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1404.jpg" width="430" height="409" align="middle"><br>
    Keep an eye on the black box pointed at with the red arrow above as this 
    will let you know how big of a circle you are creating (yes, this is a big 
    circle - you will resize it later) and <b>release</b> the mouse button and then 
    the Shift key 
    when you have an <b>800x800</b> circle (if you can't get it to go exactly to 800 px 
    don't worry about it - just get as close to 800 as you can, being 1 or 2 
	pixels off will not make a difference)</li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> to set your foreground color to black</li>
    <li>Press <b>Alt+Backspace</b> to fill the circle 
    with black</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p>Before we move on, a quick word of warning. This Step works much like the previous two Steps in 
  that you will need to keep the circle you just created selected for most of 
  this Step. To ensure that we do not mess up the original shape of our planet, 
	we will insert additional layers to place our bands of gas (and a few other 
	things) onto. If we lose our selection and need to get it back, we will 
	always have the Planet2 layer with its black circle to allow us to make a 
	selection the size of the planet (we actually have a few other uses for the black 
	circle, but we'll talk more about that later).</p>

  <li>Make <b>Planet2</b> the active layer</li>
  <li><b>Lock</b> the <b>Planet2</b> layer</li>
  <li>We will be using a gradient to simulate the bands of gas that wrap 
    around the surface of the planet, so click the <b>Gradient Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1405.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    If you do not see the Gradient Tool, just right-click the <b>Paint Bucket Tool</b> 
    and select the Gradient Tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14902.jpg" width="263" height="91" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>We will start by inserting a new layer to place the gradient that will become 
our bands of gas onto. </p>
<ol start="15">
  <li>Insert a new layer, place it at the top of the layer stack, and name it <b>
	Gradient</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14903.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to apply one of the rainbow gradients to get things started.</p>
<ol start="16">
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> on the keyboard to deselect everything</li>
	<li>On the Gradient tool options bar, click the <b>drop-down arrow</b> 
	next to the gradient box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1406.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	This will open the gradient selection window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1407.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Click the Transparent Rainbow gradient to select it...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1408.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>This gradient has 7 different colors built into it, which will be important to 
us later when we apply the Gradient Map because Photopea will take those initial 
colors and split them into multiple, individual lines of color. Keep working and 
you'll see what I'm talking about.</p>
<ol start="19">
	<li>To apply the gradient to the image, <b>click just 
    above your image</b> and <b>press and hold the Shift key</b> on the keyboard as you 
    drag down to create a line stopping just below the bottom of your image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1415.jpg" align="middle" width="500" height="440"><br>
    Your gradient should now be applied to your image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1416.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>For everything to look as realistic as possible, we will need to create a 
layer with multiple bands of gas. If you have worked with Photoshop before, you 
know that this is a fairly easy process, but in Photopea it is a little more 
complicated and involves multiple uses of Photopea's Gradient Map feature.</p>
<p>A Gradient Map is a simple adjustment, which is why it can be found in the 
Adjustments menu, that you can apply to a color image to turn it black and 
white. However, if we apply a color gradient as a Gradient Map, Photopea will 
replace dark areas of our image with colors from the left side of our gradient 
and light areas of our image with colors from the right side of our gradient. 
OK, if you didn't understand that, don't worry. When we apply a Gradient Map you 
will get a better understanding of how it works.</p>
<ol start="20">
  <li>Make sure the Gradient layer is still the active layer</li>
	<li>On the Menu Bar, click <b>Image</b> and then point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click 
	<b>Gradient Map</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1409.jpg" align="middle" width="411" height="526"><br>
	This will open the Gradient Map window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1410.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the Gradient Map window has a black and white gradient chosen by 
default (which means automatically). This is because, as we discussed earlier, 
the Gradient Map adjustment tool was originally intended to simply turn a color 
image black and white. Notice also that there is a drop-down arrow that will 
allow us to select a different gradient.</p>
<ol start="22">
	<li>Click the gradient selection drop-down arrow...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1411.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	This will bring up the gradient options...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14997.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Select the <b>Copper</b> gradient (pointed at with the red arrow above) - 
	notice that the gradient on your image should immediately change color...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1412.jpg" align="middle" width="244" height="244"></li>
	<li>Click OK...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1413.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that we now have multiple bands of color. Instead of the original 7, 
we now have at least 10 separate bands of color. Yes, we only have light and dark 
bands of a brownish color and no longer have a bunch of bright colors, but we didn't actually want a 
rainbow color planet anyway - that's just not realistic. By applying a Gradient 
Map, we have increased the number of color bands. We will add color back in 
later that will give us a much more realistic planet surface that doesn't look 
like we just dropped a rainbow into our space scene.</p>
<p>Let's apply a Gradient Map several more times to get a bunch of thin bands of 
color.</p>
<ol start="25">
	<li>Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu Bar and then point at <b>Adjustments</b> 
	and click <b>Gradient Map</b></li>
	<li>Click the gradient selection drop-down arrow and select the <b>Copper</b> 
	gradient again and click <b>OK</b> - your gradient should now look like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1414.jpg" align="middle" width="281" height="282"></li>
	<li>Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu Bar and then point at <b>Adjustments</b> 
	and click <b>Gradient Map</b></li>
	<li>Click the gradient selection drop-down arrow and select the <b>
	Transparent Rainbow</b> gradient and click <b>OK</b> - your gradient should now look like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14100.jpg" align="middle" width="288" height="283"></li>
	<li>Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu Bar and then point at <b>Adjustments</b> 
	and click <b>Gradient Map</b></li>
	<li>Click the gradient selection drop-down arrow and select the <b>
	Transparent Rainbow</b> gradient again and click <b>OK</b> - your gradient should now look like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14101.jpg" align="middle" width="288" height="285"></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that we now have lots of lines of color. Notice also that they are all 
different thickness - this is good and will help to add realism to our planet.</p>
<ol start="31">
	<li>Click <b>Image</b> on the Menu Bar and then point at <b>Adjustments</b> 
	and click <b>Gradient Map</b></li>
	<li>Click the gradient selection drop-down arrow and select the <b>Copper</b> 
	gradient one final time and click <b>OK</b> - your gradient should now look like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14102.jpg" align="middle" width="288" height="288"></li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to stop here because we've got some nice lines of various width. 
You may be wondering why we are going with this rather dull copper color as our 
final gradient. Well, as I said before, if we use the gradient from three 
directions ago with the bold reds, pinks, purples, and so on, we will make a 
planet that doesn't look realistic at all. By ending with a copper colored 
gradient, we have colors that actually exist out in space. Don't worry, we are 
not going to leave it like this. Our next task is to give our planet a little 
color, but just a little.</p>
<ol start="33">
	<li>Insert a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Gradient 
	Color</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14103.jpg" align="middle" width="321" height="134"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Gradient</b> tool is still selected</li>
	<li>On the Gradient tool options bar, click the <b>drop-down arrow</b> 
	next to the gradient box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14104.jpg" align="middle" width="350" height="81"></li>
	<li>Select the Spectrum gradient..<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14105.jpg" align="middle" width="392" height="210"></li>
	<li>Apply the gradient to your image the same way you did in direction <b>19</b></li>
</ol>
<p>We want to give our multi-line gradient just a touch of color, so let's lower 
the Opacity of the Gradient Color layer.</p>
<ol start="38">
	<li>On the Layers panel, decrease the <b>Opacity</b> of the <b>Gradient Color</b> layer to 
	<b>15%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14106.jpg" align="middle" width="322" height="156"><br>
	Notice that your bands of gas now have a slight coloration to them...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14107.jpg" align="middle" width="343" height="341"></li>
</ol>
  <p>At this point, our lines are very well defined and solid, so let's make a 
	few quick adjustments that will soften up our lines a little so they look 
	more like bands of gas on a far-away planet.</p>
<ol start="39">
	<li>Right-click the Gradient Color layer and select Merge Down - your two 
	gradient layers should now be one layer named Gradient Color (can you 
	explain why it is called that?)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14108.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>On the Menu Bar, click <b>Filter</b> and then point at <b>Blur</b> and 
	click <b>Motion Blur</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14109.jpg" align="middle" width="387" height="527"><br>
	This will open the Motion Blur window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14110.jpg" align="middle" width="546" height="189"></li>
	<li>Set the Angle to 90 and the Distance to any number between 15 and 20 - 
	I'm going to use 15...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14111.jpg" align="middle" width="544" height="189"></li>
</ol>
<p>The higher the Distance you use the blurrier your image will be. Being extra 
blurry is not necessarily a bad thing. The faster a planet spins the blurrier 
its clouds will be. Don't go above 20, because if the clouds are too blurry the 
distortions we are going to be adding next will not look right.</p>
<ol start="42">
	<li>Click OK - your gradient should now look something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14112.jpg" align="middle" width="343" height="342"></li>
</ol>
  <p>So far everything is looking pretty good, but if you look at real gas 
  giants out in space (like Jupiter and Saturn) you notice that they have 
  distortions in their bands of gas...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1417.jpg" align="middle" width="621" height="186"></p>
  <p>In other words, they do not have clean, straight 
  lines across their surfaces. Let's take a quick minute to give our planet a little 
  character by distorting the lines just a bit.</p>
<ol start="43">
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Ripple...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1418.jpg" align="middle"><br>
&nbsp;to open the Ripple window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1419.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Set the <b>Amount</b> to something between <b>200</b> (any less and you 
  won't be able to see the ripples after you resize your planet) and <b>300</b> (any more and the surface just begins to look like mush) - I'm going to use 
  <b>250</b> - and leave the <b>Size</b> set to <b>Medium</b></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> - you should now have something similar to this...<b><br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="14/14113.jpg" align="middle" width="341" height="340"></li>
</ol>
<p>Our lines no longer look perfect, but they are still pretty straight across 
the planet. Let's add some waviness to our clouds.</p>
  <ol start="46">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Wave</b> to 
    open the Wave window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1420.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Use the above settings as a starting point, and adjust the numbers until 
    you get something that you like (avoid simply using my numbers as you want 
    your planet to be unique and if everyone uses the same numbers then all 
    of the planets will look the same), but keep the following in mind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Number of Generators determines how large the 
	waves are - setting this number too high will make your planet look like a 
	cartoon, so try each number between 1 and 5 to see what gives you a result 
	you like (your waviness should look something similar to the image above)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set  Min Length to 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Max Length to any number 
    between 400 (closer together waves) and 600 (more spread out waves)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set  Min Ampl. (short for Amplitude) to 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Max Ampl. to any number 
    between 20 (shallow waves) and 40 (deep waves)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Scale X and Scale Y to 100%<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Type to Triangle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Set Undefined Areas to Wrap Around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Leave the Randomizer Seed setting alone<br>I'm going to use the numbers in the above image - keep in mind that we will be resizing our planet later in this step so 
    it is ok if the waves are a little exaggerated right now, they will look 
    fine when we resize</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>You should now have some nice, wavy, slightly distorted lines that more 
  closely resemble the actual surface of a gas giant...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1421.jpg" width="353" height="251" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">
    Keep in mind that since you (should have) used different settings than me 
    that your bands of gas will not look exactly like mine.</p><hr>
<p>Scroll back up to the picture of Jupiter and Saturn and notice that the actual 
surface of both planets have a lot more distortions on their surface than the 
planet we are creating here does. Let's take a quick second to add in some additional variations to 
our clouds (and learn some new tools in the process).</p>
  <ol start="49">
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> and then click <b>Liquify...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1423.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    This will open the Liquify window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14994.jpg" width="440" height="352" align="middle"><br>
    Yes, it's a big window</li>
    <li>In the Liquify window, click the <b>Smudge tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1424.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Hint: it is on the left at the top</li>
  </ol>
<p>The Smudge Tool does exactly what the name says: it smudges. It works very 
  much like what happens when you stick your finger in a dab of paint and move 
  it around - the paint smudges (sorry, really no better way to say it).</p>
<ol start="51">
    <li>Roll the mouse wheel up until the Zoom level is <b>100%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1425.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Hint: it is on the left at the bottom</li>
    <li>Under <b>View Options</b>, click the <b>Background</b> checkbox to turn 
	it on and set the <b>Opacity</b> to <b>90</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1426.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	This will allow us to see the black circle of our planet behind our bands of 
	gas...<br>
	<img border="0" src="14/1422.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
<p>Being able to see where our planet sits is helpful because it lets us know 
where to make the changes in the next few directions. Everything outside the shaded 
circle area will be deleted, so don't bother making adjustments to the lines outside 
the shaded circle.</p>
<ol start="53">
    <li>On the right side of the Liquify window, set the options to match the 
	image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1427.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Click</b> and <b>drag</b> quickly in your clouds in various directions and at

    <b>DO NOT</b> go crazy with your smudges - try to space them out as we will be 
    decreasing the size of the brush in the following directions and adding 
    additional smudges of various sizes to give our planet a lot more character</li>
  </ol>
<p>When creating the smudges, if you click and drag quickly you will pull the 
color where you click a longer distance than if you click and drag slowly, which 
will tend to blend together the colors you drag over.</p>
<ol start="55">
    <li>Place smudges around your image (but don't go CRAZY) - if you need to 
	reposition your planet so you can see a different area, you can press and hold the spacebar and then click 
	and drag to move your planet around</li>
    <li>Press the <b>[</b> key on your keyboard twice to decrease the size of 
    your brush from <b>35</b> to <b>25</b></li>
    <li><b>Add</b> in some additional smudges - again, don't over do it</li>
    <li>Press the <b>[</b> key on your keyboard twice to decrease the size of 
    your brush from <b>25</b> to <b>15</b></li>
    <li><b>Add</b> in some additional smudges - this time you can make as many as you 
    like (you can even draw onto some of the previous smudges)</li>

    additional distortions to your clouds (keep in mind that the longer you 
    press the mouse button on one spot the more Photopea will draw the 
    surrounding area into your circle) - once again, do not go crazy with this</li>

  <p>The Shrink tool is a great way to create thinner bands of gas...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/14998.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">Simply click and hold the Shrink tool as you drag along a band

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="14/14114.jpg" align="middle" width="48" height="53"></p>
<p>It functions the opposite of the Shrink tool. When using the Blow tool, 
anything inside the brush circle will be pushed out from the center toward the 
edges. If you have areas that you want to be slightly more spread out, you can 
place the Blow tool over that area and click multiple times, or click and hold 
to slowly apply the Blow.</p>
<ol start="65">
    <li><b>Look</b> over your planet and decide if there are any areas you would like 
	to spread out and use the Blow tool on those areas - be extra careful not to 
	over use the Blow tool because the more you use it the more unrealistic your

<p>What might be awesome at this point is to add in a nice storm to simulate 
something like the 
Great Red Spot on Jupiter...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1432.jpg" align="middle" width="206" height="167"></p>
<p align="left">This spot on Jupiter is actually a huge hurricane that has been 
churning for decades, maybe even centuries.
    Let's start by creating a selection to contain our storm.</p>
<ol start="72">
  <li><b>Click </b>the <b>Ellipse Select tool</b> - make sure <b>Feather</b> is set to 
	<b>0</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14115.jpg" align="middle" width="373" height="66"></li>
  <li><b>Draw</b> an oval over the empty area of your image (NOT on your planet) that is 
  <b>200px 
  wide</b> by <b>100px high</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1433.jpg" align="middle" width="457" height="158"><br>
  Don't waste a lot of time trying to get your selection to be exactly 200x100 - 
  just get close</li>
  <li><b>Determine</b> where on your planet you would like your storm to be - it 
    should on the same side of the planet as your sun (in other words, if you 
    put your sun on the right side of your image like I did then you want your 
    storm to be on the right side of your planet since we are going to shade the 
    other side later in this step and you want your storm to be visible) and looks best when placed in darker bands of color 
  (if you place it over light colored clouds it will be difficult to see when 
  you resize your planet)</li>
  <li><b>Click</b> inside the selection (your cursor should look like this:
    <img border="0" src="14/1434.jpg" align="bottom" width="39" height="37"> 
  while over the selection) and <b>drag</b> it onto the area of your planet that you 
  chose...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1435.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Twirl...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1436.jpg" align="middle" width="345" height="463"><br>
  This opens the Twirl window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1437.jpg" align="middle" width="462" height="227"><br>
	Note that the preview of the planet shows what the twirl will look like when 
	applied</li>
  <li>Set angle to <b>300 degrees</b> as in the image above</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
  <li><b>Press and hold the Shift</b> key and press the <b>right arrow key 10 
	times</b> (or press the left arrow key 10 times depending on how close to 
	the edge of your planet you placed the first twirl) - this will move your 
	selection 100 pixels to the right...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1438.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>Using just the arrow keys to move something left or right (or up and down) 
will move the object 1 pixel each time you press the arrow key. But
<font color="#FF0000">by holding down the Shift key, we force Photopea to move 
the selection area 10 pixels with each press of the arrow key</font>. In this 
way, we can precisely control how far we move selections and objects, but don't 
have to press the arrow key a hundred times to get it where we want.</p>
<ol start="80">
  <li>Reapply the <b>Twirl</b> <b>filter</b> (use the same settings as before) - you should now have something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1442.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key and press the <b>left</b> <b>arrow</b>
	<b>key</b> (or the right if you used the left one earlier) five times to 
	move your selection oval <b>50 pixels</b> back toward your 
  original twirl so it sits between the two twirls you just 
  made...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1443.jpg" align="middle" width="263" height="97"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Twirl</b> to reopen the Twirl 
  window, but this time set the angle to <b>400 degrees</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1444.jpg" align="middle"><br>
  This should combine the first two twirls into one large twirl...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1445.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Press <b>Crtl+D</b> to deselect the oval</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be wondering why we didn't just create one large twirl at an angle of 400  
and be done with it. Remember that the bands of gas on our planet (and on the 
real gas planets in our solar system) are created due to the planet spinning 
really fast and, because there is no solid ground to provide friction, stretching the gas 
across the surface of the planet. Because of this, a simple round storm would 
look out of place. By applying two small twirls and merging them into one large 
twirl we are able to create a storm that is definitely noticeable, but that 
blends into the surrounding clouds and looks stretched out so that it could 
actually be on our planet and not look like some weird artificial storm we 
stuck on same fake planet using Photopea (and now you know why the Great Red 
Spot on 
Jupiter is an oval...you're welcome).</p>
<p>Let's make one more minor adjustment before we move on. If you look at the 
Great Red Spot on Jupiter in the image above you will notice that the center is 
far less defined (it's blurrier) than the center of our storm. We have a 
quick fix we can use to soften up the center of our storm.</p>
<ol start="84">
  <li>Click the <b>Smudge Tool</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1446.jpg" align="middle"><br>
  You may have to right-click the Blur Tool and then select the Smudge Tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14995.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Choose the <b>Soft Mechanical 24 pixels </b>brush and make the Size <b>70 px</b></li>
	<li><b>Click</b> in the center of your storm and move your mouse back and 
  forth slightly (do not go too far or you will begin to remove the oval shape 
  of the storm) until your center is well blended - it should look something 
  similar to the image below...<br>
	<img border="0" src="14/1447.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>Now let's give our planet a quick spherize so that the bands of gas seem to be 
moving around an actual round surface instead of sitting across a flat surface 
like 
they actually do. We will do this the same way we did it on the first planet. We 
need to first reselect our planet shape.<ol start="87">
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key and click on the <b>Planet2</b> 
    layer's thumbnail...<br>

	<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>

  <hr>
  <p>You should now have an awesome looking gas planet. Since this planet is covered with all kinds of strange gasses and doesn't 
  have clouds like we do on earth, we don't have to worry about creating cloud 
  layers and just need to apply a nice glow to 
  the Planet2 layer.</p>

  <hr>
<p>We now need to add in a shadow. With Planet 1, we started with a full black 
circle and erased part of it until we had a nice shadow. For this planet, let's 
use a different method.</p>
<ol start="109">
    <li><b>&nbsp;Lock</b> the <b>Gradient Color</b> layer</li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Shadow</b>...<b><br>
	</b>

    <li>&nbsp;Turn on the <b>visibility</b> of the <b>Star Field</b> layer group (the black

  <li><b>&nbsp;</b>Make sure your planet shape is still selected (if it is not,
	<b>Ctrl+click</b> on the Planet2 
  layer's <b>thumbnail</b> to select your entire planet) and notice that the outer 
  glow is not included in the selection...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14999.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to add a shadow on top of the main body of our planet first, and 
then we will deal with removing the outer glow on the shadow side of the planet. 
Trust me - this is going to work.</p>
<ol start="113">
  <li>&nbsp;Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard to make black your foreground color</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Choose the <b>Brush Tool</b></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Change the brush selection to <b>Soft Mechanical 24 pixels</b>, and change the <b>Size
    </b>to <b>500 px</b></li>
    <li>&nbsp;On the Brush Tool options bar, make sure <span class="style1"><b>
    <font color="#000000">Opacity</font></b><font color="#000000"> (the depth of color)</font></span> 
    and <span class="style1"><b>Flow</b> (the amount of color you drop each time 
    you stroke)</span> are both set to <b>50%</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1466.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>&nbsp;<b>Zoom out</b> so you can see your entire planet and some of the area around 
	it</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Make sure the <b>Shadow</b> layer is the active layer and <b>click</b> 
    on one side of your planet and <b>drag</b> around to the other side...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1468.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Keep your cursor half-on your planet as in the image above and make sure you 
    are shading the side of the planet <i><b>AWAY</b></i> from the sun (notice 
    how the image above indicates that my Sun is in the upper right-hand corner of 
    my image so I'm shading the bottom left of my planet) - you should now have something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1469.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Notice that you have a slight shadow - yes, it is supposed to be that 
    subtle, you will make it darker in the following directions</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Press the <b>]</b> key on the keyboard once to increase the size of your 
    brush to <b>600</b></li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Repeat</b> direction <b>118</b>, but put slightly less of the cursor

    <img border="0" src="14/1470.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Press the <b>]</b> key on the keyboard once to increase the size of your

    <li><b>&nbsp;Repeat</b> direction <b>118</b>, but put slightly less of the cursor 
    on your planet</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Press the <b>]</b> key on the keyboard once to increase the size of your 
    brush to <b>800</b></li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Repeat</b> direction <b>118</b>, but put slightly less of the cursor 
    on your planet</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Press the <b>]</b> key on the keyboard once to increase the size of your 
    brush to <b>900</b></li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Repeat</b> direction <b>118</b>, but put slightly less of the cursor 
    on your planet</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Press the <b>]</b> key on the keyboard once to increase the size of your 
    brush to <b>1000</b></li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Repeat</b> direction <b>118</b>, but put slightly less of the cursor 
    on your planet - you should now have a nice, soft shadow...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1471.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Notice that because the planet is selected that we only drew over the planet 
    so that the stars in the image are still 
    shining just as bright as they were before we began this Step</li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Lock</b> the Shadow layer</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's deal with the outer glow. Because the outer glow is a layer style 
and not something we actually drew on our planet, we can't simply erase the 
outer glow. However, since we applied the outer glow to the Planet2 layer (which 
you'll remember is just a black circle), if we remove part of the black circle 
on the shadow part of the planet, we can push the outer glow back so that it is 
not visible. If that made no sense at all, don't worry. After we make this 
change you will understand.</p>
<ol start="130">
	<li>&nbsp;Make the <b>Planet2</b> layer the active layer</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b> and use the <b>Soft Mechanical</b> brush 
	with a size of <b>500</b> pixels...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1440.jpg" align="middle" width="344" height="232"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click and drag the same way you did in direction <b>118</b> to 
	remove the outer glow on the shadow side of the planet - you should now have 
	something that looks like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1449.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so I said that we can't directly erase the outer glow because it is 
applied using a layer style, so why does it appear that we were able to erase it? Well, if we turn off 
the Shadow and Gradient Color layers we see this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1450.jpg" align="middle" width="311" height="305"></p>
<p>This is what is left of our Planet2 black circle after we erased the part on 
the shadow side in the last direction. Notice that the outer glow is actually 
still there. It's not as solid and bright as it is around the other side of the 
planet because we used an eraser with a soft edge, but it is still there. We 
have basically just pushed it back so that it is not visible on the shadow side 
of our planet anymore. With the Shadow and Gradient Color layers above our Planet2 layer, 
people viewing our image will never know that the outer glow on the shadow side 
is there.</p>
<hr>
<p>Things are looking pretty good, but at this point all of your planets look 
pretty much the same, which is pretty boring. Let's take a second to modify the color of 
your 
planet so that everyone has a unique planet. We could simply take our Planet2 
layer and edit the colors directly, but doing so would permanently change our 
planet. If we close our image or continue on with <a href="step15.html">Step 15</a>, 
we would be 
unable to get our planet back to the way it currently looks or to modify any changes 
we made. Luckily for us, Photopea offers a way to modify a layer without doing 
so permanently. This can be done with an <b>adjustment layer</b>.</p>
<p> 
    <span class="style2">Adjustment layers are layers that sit over other layers and make some sort of 
  change to them</span>. The good thing about adjustment layers is that unlike 
    actually changing a layer, changes made using adjustment layers can be 
    quickly and easily undone (by deleting the adjustment layer) or easily 
    changed (by modifying the adjustment layer).</p>
<p> 
    We need to give our planet a color scheme we like at this point because 
    later we will be adding a ring system and will need to apply color to the 
    rings based on the color of our planet's swirling clouds. We are going to 
    need a new layer that sits above our Gradient Color layer.</p>

</ol>
<p>At this point you might be thinking: huh, what's going on? Colorize is a 
great tool to use when we want to add color to an image that has no color (such 
as a black and white image). Using it now causes our planet to be <font color="#FF0000">

about whether you like the monochromatic look or if you prefer the multi-colored 
bands.</p>

  of the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer - try each blending mode until you find 
  one that you like (do not use any that make your planet look unnatural - such

  find a setting you like leave it set to that (you are certainly free to use 
  the default Normal setting if you like it best)</li>

<p>I'm going to leave my blending mode set to Normal.</p>
<hr>
<p>Keep something very important in mind at this point - if you do not like any 
of the 
adjustments you have made you can always make changes to your adjustment layer. 
Take a look at your Layers panel and locate the Hue icon (red arrow below) 
located on your Hue/Saturation 1 layer...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1482.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">This icon indicates that the layer is modifying the 
Hue/Saturation of our image. By the way, if you are wondering what that 
<font color="#FF0000">white circle inside the black box to the right of the 
Hue/Saturation icon is for, it is there to indicate what specific parts of our 
image are being adjusted</font>. Since we had our planet shape selected when we 
applied this particular adjustment layer, it is only being 
applied to the circle, or what is in white. If we want to apply the 
adjustment to the entire image, we would simply apply it with nothing selected 
and our adjustment layer icon would look like this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1483.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p align="left">The white box indicates that the adjustment is being 
applied to everything. To make changes to your adjustment layer, you simply need to double-click on the Hue icon to get the 
Hue/Saturation Property panel from direction 136 to pop back up. This is the 
real power of adjustment layers - we can make tons of changes to our image 
without having a direct impact on our layers.</p>
<hr>
<p>So far everything is looking pretty good, but let's take this planet to the next 
level by adding in some Saturn-like rings. Our planet is rather large now and it will be 
difficult to create rings large enough to go around it, so let's make our planet 
a little smaller.</p>

    <img border="0" src="14/14910.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Use the top (or bottom) center resize handle to squish your rings into 
    an oval, and then adjust their width so that they are slightly wider than your planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1463.jpg" align="middle" width="298" height="175"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Tilt your rings so they are <b>at

    <li>&nbsp;When you are happy with your rings press the <b>Enter</b> key to 
	apply the transform</li>
</ol>
It is important that your rings sit at the same angle as your bands of gas. 
Quick astronomy lesson here: for planets that have rings, they are generally 
formed when two orbiting bodies, like moons, smash into each other and break 
apart (they can also be formed by a passing object being captured by the 
planet's gravity and broken into little tiny pieces like an elephant stepping on 
a chocolate chip cookie...which we all know is a waste of a perfectly good 
cookie). The pieces are then scattered around the planet due to the planet's 
spin. Thus, the rings are almost always distributed in the same shape as the 
planet's bands of gas. In other words, your rings should sit at the same angle 
as your bands of gas.<p>Our rings are really smooth, so let's make them look a little more rock-like.</p>
<ol start="175">
    <li>&nbsp;Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Noise</b> and click <b>Add Noise...</b></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Make your settings match those below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1493.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Click <b>OK</b> - your rings should now look something like 
	this...<b><br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="14/1464.jpg" align="middle"></li>
</ol>
Notice that your rings now have a slight grainy texture to them, almost like the 
rings are composed of tiny rocks floating in space instead of just big smudge 
around the planet. And while our rings do look more realistic now, we still have 
a small issue. Planet with real rings out in space have light bouncing off their 
surface which gives their rings a slight hint of color. Let's take a moment and 
give our rings a slight tint.<ol start="178">
    <li>&nbsp;Click <b>Image</b> and point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>
    Hue/Saturation</b> and change the settings so that the rings have a nice, 
    slight tint to them (you will need to drag the Saturation slider to right 
	first to apply some color, and then adjust the Hue slider to find a color 
	that matches your planet) - remember that since our rings are originally 
	black and white that you will need to turn on the Colorize option in the lower 
	left-hand corner of the Hue/Saturation 
    window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1478.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Your rings should now have some color...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1495.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Everyone has different colors in their planet, so I can't tell you exactly what settings to use - just play around with them until  you get something you like 
    (remember that we are going for just a slight amount of color, so be sure 
	that you are not applying too much color by keeping the saturation value 
	low)</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Click <b>OK</b> to exit the Hue/Saturation window</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Turn on the <b>visibility</b> of your <b>Shadow</b> and <b>Planet2</b> 
	layers, as well as your Starfield layer folder (you still want the Rings layer 
    to be selected, just make sure you can see the Shadow layer so you know 
    where to erase the rings)</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b> and use the Soft Mechanical brush 
	with a size of around 200 pixels and erase the part of the rings that are 
    behind the planet, and remove some of the rings that are in the planet's 
    shadow (the rings will look more realistic if you leave some slightly visible in the 
    shadow - this can be easily done by turning the Opacity and 
    Flow settings in the Eraser Tool options bar down to 50% each and gradually 
    removing the rings until you have something you like)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1496.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Feel free to increase the size of the brush as needed to get a nice set of 
	rings in the shadow, just be sure that your rings do not cover up your storm 
	(notice that my rings are on the top part of my planet while my storm is safely on 
	the bottom)</li>
</ol>
<p>We have one more quick thing to fix before we move on with our lives. Take a 
look at my outer glow in the above image. Notice that while my planet has a 
definite purplish tint to it that my outer glow is still the yellowish color 
that it was before I adjust the Hue of my bands of gas. It looks a little odd at 
this point, so let's take a quick second and make an adjustment to our outer 
glow (and cover some great info on how to adjust an existing layer style!) so 
that the color more correctly matches our planet.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that depending on how you set the color of your planet, that your 
outer glow may not need to be adjusted because it is already a good color. If 
that is your situation, follow along with the directions below anyway just so 
you have experience adjusting an existing layer style.</p>
<ol start="183">
  <li><b>&nbsp;</b>On the <b>Layers</b> panel, double-click the <b>eff</b> icon 
	on the Gradient Color layer...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1467.jpg" align="middle" width="322" height="213"><br>
	This will open the Layer Style window</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click the <b>Outer Glow</b> selector...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1494.jpg" align="middle" width="273" height="113"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click the <b>Set color of glow </b>box...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1457.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click the plus sign cursor on an area of color on your planet that 
	you want to your outer glow to be</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click <b>OK</b> to exit the Color Picker</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Click <b>OK</b> to exit the Layer Style widow</li>
</ol>
<p>Your planet should now have a nice glow that fits your overall color 
scheme...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/14119.jpg" align="middle" width="420" height="284"></p>
<p align="left">In the image above, I used the color in the wide, center band of 
gas as my outer glow. By using a layer style instead of making a change directly to 
our Gradient Color layer, we are able to make changes whenever we need without 
messing up our original colors.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Our final task is to get all of our Planet2 layers into a layer 
folder and find a nice home in our space scene for our wonderful 
Jupiter/Saturn hybrid planet to sit.</p>
<ol start="189">
  <li><b>&nbsp;Select</b> all five of the layers that make up your second planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1497.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>&nbsp;Click 
    the <b>New Folder </b>icon</li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;Rename</b> the new layer folder <b>Planet2</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1498.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>&nbsp;Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your planet (remember to hold the Shift key as you drag one of 
    the corners to resize both the height and width at the same time) to something that fits your scene, then move it where you would like it to be 
    (remember that you can still use Edit - Transform - Flip Horizontal/Vertical 
    to reposition your planet if you need to, just remember that you may need to 
    rotate it again to keep the shadow away from the sun)</li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure you are not placing your amazing Planet2 on top of any of your large 
stars.</p>
<ol start="193">
    <li><b>&nbsp;Lock</b> all of your layer folders</li>
</ol>
With all of your layer groups and layers turned on, you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="14/1499.jpg" align="middle"></p>
<p>The absolute best part about how we built out Planet2 is that once we get all 
parts of our space scene turned on, if there is something that we don't like we 
can easily make an adjustment. For example, comparing my two planets I see that 
the outer glow on my Planet2 is so much larger than my Planet1 that it looks out 
of place - the fix for this is easy.</p>
<ol start="194">
	<li>&nbsp;If the outer glow of your Planet2 is too bright, simply unlock the 
	Planet2 layer folder</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Expand the contents of the Planet2 layer folder by clicking the
	<font color="#FF0000">expand folder arrow</font>... <br>
    <img border="0" src="14/1465.jpg" align="middle" width="324" height="115"><br>

    <img border="0" src="14/14120.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Select the Planet2 layer (remember that this is where the outer 
	glow lives)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Decrease the Opacity of your Planet2 layer until your outer glow 
	fits better into your scene - I set mine to 65%...<br>
    <img border="0" src="14/14904.jpg" align="middle" width="665" height="665"></li>
	<li>&nbsp;Collapse (by clicking the <b>expander folder arrow </b>again) and 
	lock your <b>Planet2</b> layer folder</li>
</ol>
<p>So far it looks pretty good, but there are all kinds of other things floating 
through space such as comets and asteroids, so let's add in some of those.</p>
