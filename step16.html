  <p>Asteroids are rocks floating through space. We will use a few filters and 
  some new tools as we insert (at least) 3 asteroids into our space scene.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space15</b> 
  	file in Photopea</li>
    <li>Turn off the <b>visibility</b> of <b>all</b> of your layer folders - 
	note that you can quickly and easily turn off the visibility of everything 
	in your Layers panel by clicking on the top visibility icon (the eye) and 
	dragging down to the bottom visibility icon...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1636.jpg" width="192" height="232" align="middle"><br>
	You should be left with the checkerboard</li>
    <li><b><a name="dir1"></a>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of your layer 
    stack and name it <b>Asteroid1 </b></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Lasso Tool</b> and set <b>Feather</b> on the Lasso Tool's 
    option bar to
    <b>5px</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="16/1601.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press <font color="#FF0000"> <b>Ctrl+R</b> on the keyboard to turn on 
	Photopea's Rulers</font> </li>
</ol>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+R should only cause your rulers to appear, so if your browser 
gives you a pop-up window, simply dismiss the window and use the menu (click 
View and then click Rulers) to turn on the rulers instead.</p>
<ol start="6">
    <li><b>Zoom</b> in (press the Alt key and roll the mouse wheel up) until you can see an area of your image that is about <b>300x300</b> 
    pixels in size - use the ruler you just turned on to determine when you have 
    zoomed in enough...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1602.jpg" width="705" height="36" align="middle"><br>
    The ruler above is displaying approximately 335 pixels</li>
</ol>
<p>Since many of us are using different screen resolutions, it is not possible 
for me to give you an exact Zoom amount. You want to zoom in to a point where 
you can create a nicely shaped asteroid and ensure that it is not too big, as 
having an overly large asteroid will cause problems later on.</p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li><b>Draw</b> an <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ovoid">ovoid</a> shape...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1603.jpg" width="157" height="149" align="middle"><br>
    Don't draw it too close to the edge of your image - keep in mind that you 
    will move it later</li>
</ol>
<p>An important thing to keep in mind here is that you want to create an 
asteroid shape that is oval. In other words, make sure it is roundish, kinda 
like a fat potato or a dented egg. Avoid creating an asteroid that is oddly shaped or has strange things sticking 
off of it such as this...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="16/1604.jpg" width="198" height="159" align="middle"></p>
<p>While asteroids like this are physically possible and in fact do exist, they 
are very rare. Rounded asteroids are far more common (asteroids tend to get rounded 
by colliding with other asteroids which, over time, breaks off protruding pieces of 
rock) and will look much better in our 
space scene because they will be easily recognizable as an asteroid where the 
shape above will cause many viewers of our image to say &quot;huh?&quot;</p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard (remember what this does?)</li>
  <li>Press <b>Alt+Backspace</b> on the keyboard (remember what this does?)</li>
  <li>Press <font color="#FF0000"><b>X</b> on the keyboard (this is the keyboard 
  shortcut to swap the Foreground and Background colors)</font> - you should now 
  have white as your Foreground color and black as your Background color</li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Clouds</b> - your shape should 
  look something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1605.jpg" width="152" height="146" align="middle"><br>
  Keep in mind that you will have a different shape than mine and it will be 
	filled with a different pattern than mine</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Difference 
    Clouds</b> - your shape should look something like this...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="16/1606.jpg" width="150" height="146" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Click <b>Filter</b> and then click <b>Filter Gallery...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1607.jpg" align="middle"><br>
  This opens the Filter Gallery window</li>
  <li>Click the drop-down arrow and choose <b>Bas Relief</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1608.jpg" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Make <b>Detail</b> and <b>Smoothness</b> match the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1609.jpg" width="283" height="194" align="middle"><br>
  For the <b>Light</b> option, you can choose either Left or Right, so click on each 
  one and see which one gives you the best looking asteroid</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b> to exit the Filter Gallery - your asteroid should look 
  something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1610.jpg" width="154" height="148" align="middle"></li>
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl+D</b> to deselect your asteroid</li>
</ol>
<p>So far our first asteroid looks pretty good. We are not done with it, but 
let's take a moment right now to quickly create another asteroid and then we 
will do some additional editing on both of them to make sure that they do not 
look exactly alike. We are going to create the second asteroid by cheating a 
little and duplicating pieces of the first one.</p>
<ol start="18">
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+R</b> to turn off the Rulers</li>
    <li>Insert a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Asteroid2</b></li>
    <li>Click the <b>Clone Tool</b>...<br>
    <span class="style2">
    <img border="0" src="16/1611.jpg" align="absbottom"></span></li>
  </ol>
<span class="style2">The <b>Clone Tool</b> allows you to 
    copy one area of your image onto another area.<font color="#000000"> In 
other words, you can create an exact 'clone' of one part of your image and place 
it in another part of your image. For us, we will be using the Clone Tool 
to use pieces of our first asteroid to build our second asteroid. Follow the 
directions below, and exactly how the Clone Tool works will become obvious.</font></span><ol start="21">
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+0</b> on the keyboard - this will set your zoom level so that you can see your entire space 
    scene at once (at this point your space scene should contain only your first asteroid and the transparent 
    checkerboard pattern because you should still have the visibility of all of 
    the layer folders turned off)</li>
    <li>On the Clone Tool options bar, select the <b>Soft Mechanical 24 pixels</b> 
	brush and set the size to <b>30 px</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1631.jpg" width="349" height="232" align="absbottom"></li>
  </ol>
<p> <span class="style2"><span class="style3">To use the Clone Tool, </span></span>
we first need to 
    determine the area of the image we wish to copy - which for us is parts of 
our first asteroid - and then we need to determine where we want to copy the 
parts of the image to - which for us will be in a blank area beside our first 
asteroid. Let's try this and see how it works.</p>
<ol start="23">
  <li>
    <span class="style2"><b>Press</b> and <b>hold</b> the <b>Alt</b> key - 
    notice that as you hold the Alt key down that the cursor changes to a plus 
	sign...<br>
    </span>
    <img border="0" src="16/1612.jpg" align="absbottom"><span class="style2"><br>
    this is how Photopea tells you that you are about to define an area to 
    clone from<font color="#000000"> - click in the center of asteroid 1 and 
    release the Alt key</font></span></li>
</ol>
<p>It may look like nothing is happening, but Photopea remembers 
where you clicked and will begin copying what is at that spot to the new area when 
you begin to draw.</p>
<ol start="24">
  <li>
    <b>Move</b> the cursor to the empty area beside asteroid 1</li>
  <li>
    <b>Click</b> and <b>drag</b> the mouse around - notice as you do this that 
    Photopea places a tiny <b>+</b> sign over the spot where you originally 
    clicked in direction 23 and that as you drag the tiny plus sign is following 
    the motion of your mouse</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of you will notice a slight problem at this point - nothing is actually being 
drawn. So what's going on? It turns out that by default Photopea is set up to 
clone regions only on one layer, and since the layer we are currently drawing on 
(which should be Asteroid2) is blank, we are not actually drawing anything right 
now. To fix this problem, we need to make a quick adjustment to our Clone 
Tool's options bar.</p>
<ol start="26">
  <li>
    On the Clone Tool options bar, set <b>Source:</b> to Current &amp; Below....<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1614.jpg" align="absbottom"><br>
    This will allow us to pull from not only our current layer but also from the 
    layer directly below it</li>
  <li>
    <b>Alt+click</b> once more on the center of asteroid 1</li>
  <li>
    <b>Move</b> the cursor to the empty area beside asteroid 1 and
    <b>click</b> and <b>drag</b> the mouse around - you should now be cloning 
    asteroid 1 in the new location...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1615.jpg" width="226" height="195" align="absbottom"><br>
    Draw until you have created a new asteroid approximately half the size of 
    asteroid 1...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1616.jpg" width="217" height="192" align="absbottom"><br>
    Try not to make the overall shape of your second asteroid the same shape as 
    the first one, and avoid the edge of asteroid 1 (it has a less than perfect 
    edge that we will need to deal with later)</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that since Photopea is copying whatever is in the original area 
that if you go off your asteroid that nothing will be copied.
    Looking at asteroid 2 at this point you may notice that it looks like a 
    miniature version of asteroid 1 (because it is). Let's do some quick adjusting to make 
    asteroid 2 look a little more unique.</p>
<ol start="29">
    <li>Make sure the <b>Asteroid2</b> layer is the active layer</li>
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> on the menu bar and point at <b>Adjustments</b> and 
    click <b>Invert</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1617.jpg" width="364" height="378" align="absbottom"><br>
    This turns the dark parts of our asteroid light and the light parts dark...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1618.jpg" width="265" height="110" align="absbottom"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> and then click <b>Free Transform</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>size</b> of the asteroid in some way - you can drag any 
    resize handle to make the rock wider, thinner, taller, shorter, or use a 
    corner to adjust both height and width at the same time - then <b>rotate</b> 
    it so that it sits at a different angle from asteroid 1...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1619.jpg" width="241" height="228" align="absbottom"></li>
    <li>Press <b>Enter</b> to apply the transform</li>
  </ol>
<p>You should now have two asteroids that hopefully do not look like exact copies 
of each other. If you are happy with your two asteroids then skip the following 
direction, but if your asteroids still look too much alike, do this:</p>
<ol start="34">
  <li>If your asteroids still look alike, click the <b>Eraser</b> tool and use a
  <b>Soft Mechanical</b> brush with size set to <b>50 px</b> to remove parts of asteroid 2's edge until 
  it appears unique - remember to keep it roundish</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's make a quick adjustment that will give our space rocks some extra 
dimension and help to keep the surface looking nice when we shrink them down in 
the coming directions.</p>
<ol start="35">
    <li>Click the <span class="style1">Sharpen Tool</span>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1620.jpg" align="absbottom"><br>
    You may have to right-click the Blur Tool and then select the Sharpen 
    Tool...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1632.jpg" align="absbottom"></li>
	<li>On the Sharpen Tool options bar, set Strength to 
    <b>50%</b>...<b><br></b>
	<img border="0" src="16/1633.jpg" align="absbottom"></li>
  </ol>
<p>The <span class="style2">Sharpen Tool increases the detail of our selection</span>, which 
will help to make our asteroids look like they are actually made out of rock.</p>
<ol start="37">
    <li>Make <b>Asteroid1</b> the active layer</li>
    <li>On the Sharpen Tool options bar set the brush to <b>Soft Mechanical</b> and 
    the Size to <b>30 px</b></li>
    <li><b>Click</b> and drag an area of the asteroid you want to sharpen - 
    notice this process does not 
    result in a huge change...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1621.jpg" width="602" height="192" align="absbottom"><br>
    Do not sharpen the entire asteroid or your rock will look unnatural - we just want some additional detail so our rocks look like they actually 
    have peaks and valleys and will maintain a sharp, crisp appearance when we 
    make them smaller</li>
    <li><b>Repeat</b> the above three directions on asteroid <b>2</b></li>
  </ol>
<p>Two asteroids down, so we just need to create one more. Keep in mind that you 
can create more asteroids if you wish to make your scene unique (3 is the 
minimum), but don't go crazy and add in tons of asteroids or your planets will 
become fiery-asteroid-crashing-death-traps.</p>
<ol start="41">
    <li><b>Create</b> an additional asteroid (name it <b>Asteroid3</b>) by going back to <a href="#dir1">
    direction 3</a> and following directions 3-17 and directions 35-39</li>
  </ol>
<p>Creating asteroid 3 from scratch ensures that our third asteroid is 
completely unique and different from the other two. <b><font color="#800000">DO 
NOT</font></b> simply create your third (or any 
other) asteroid by duplicating asteroids 1 or 2. If you do this you will get <b>
NO</b> credit for having 
created your final asteroid. Also, your space scene will look stupid. Think about 
it: there are not two <i>identical</i> asteroids floating around the universe. Take some 
pride in your work.</p>
<p>At this point, if we turn on our other layers we will see that our asteroids 
are actually pretty bright when compared to the rest of the stuff in our 
image...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="16/1622.jpg" width="334" height="189" align="absbottom"></p>
<p align="left">We need to make a quick change to each asteroid so that it looks 
more like it is actually a rock flying through the blackness of outer space.</p>
  <ol start="42">
    <li>Make <b>Asteroid1</b> the active layer</li>
    <li>Click <b>Image</b> and point at <b>Adjustments</b> and click <b>Levels</b></li>
    <li><b>Click</b> on the Levels window's title bar and <b>drag</b> it to a spot where you can 
    see both the Levels window and your asteroid 1</li>
    <li>Drag the <b>black Input Levels</b> arrow...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1634.jpg" align="absbottom"><br>
    to the right until your 
    asteroid has a nice combination of light and dark areas - what amount you 
    use 
    is up to you, but a value between 70 and 120 will work best (note that it is 
	ok if your histogram looks different than mine)</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li><b>Repeat</b> the above <b>5 directions</b> for asteroids <b>2</b> and
    <b>3 </b>(it is ok to set different level amounts for each of your asteroids 
    - the amount of light and shadow on each rock depends on where they are in 
    your space scene and thus will not be the same for each one when you move 
    them around a few directions from now)</li>
  </ol>
<p>Things are looking pretty good at this point, but if you zoom in on asteroid 
1 you will most likely see a potential problem (you may need to turn on your 
star field to see it)...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="16/1623.jpg" width="234" height="83" align="absbottom"></p>
<p>Notice the strange white glow around the edge of the asteroid? This is left 
over from when we applied the filters at the start of this step and can end up being 
a real issue when we resize our asteroids or when we move them around and place 
them over other elements in our image and the white edge becomes noticeable. 
Let's take a quick second to remove this edge.</p>
  <ol start="48">
    <li>Make <b>Asteroid1</b> the active layer</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser</b> tool</li>
    <li>On the Eraser tool options bar, ser the brush to <b>Soft Mechanical</b> 
	and the size to <b>40 px</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1624.jpg" align="absbottom"><br>
	Note that a size of 40 works for my asteroid, but if your asteroid is 
	considerably larger (or smaller) than mine, you may need to use a different 
	size</li>
    <li>Click and drag around the outside of your asteroid until you have erased 
	the white border...<table border="0" width="36%">
		<tr>
			<td align="center" width="50%">Go from this:</td>
			<td align="center" width="50%">To this:</td>

		</tr>
	</table>
	</li>
  </ol>
<p>Zoom out and take a look at your asteroid - it should have a nice, not white 
edge to it...</p>
<p align="center">

    <img border="0" src="16/1626.jpg" align="absbottom" width="340" height="263"></p>
<p>Note that when you resize your asteroid and make it smaller that it will lose 
some of the detail and imperfections around the edges. This is supposed to 
happen, so don't worry too much about it.</p>
<ol start="52">
    <li>Repeat the above <b>4</b> directions to correct the edges of both <b>
	Asteroid2</b> and <b>Asteroid3</b></li>
	<li>Zoom out and make sure that the edges of all three of your asteroids 
	look good</li>
  </ol>
<p>Now that our asteroids are ready to go, let's get them in a more believable 
size.</p>
  <ol start="54">
    <li><b>Resize</b> all your asteroids so they are in scale with the other objects 
    in your scene - you can make them different sizes so that they appear to be 
    different distances away (your asteroids should not be as large as your 
    planets, but instead should be awesome little [but not too little] additions 
    to your solar system)</li>
    <li>Resizing your asteroids may make them brighter than what we want, so 
    take a second now and have a look at your asteroids and see if they are too 
    bright - if they are so bright that they stand out in your scene (they 
    should appear to blend in and be an extra element in the background and not 
    the focal point of the scene), simply repeat directions <b>42-47</b> to make 
    them darker</li>
    <li><b>Scatter</b> the asteroids throughout your image</li>
    <li><b>Select</b> all of the asteroid layers...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1628.jpg" align="absbottom"></li>
    <li>Click the <b>New Folder</b> icon</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new Folder group to <b>Asteroids</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="16/1629.jpg" align="absbottom"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Asteroids group</li>
  </ol>
With all of your layer groups and layers turned on you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="16/1630.jpg" width="601" height="600" align="middle"></p>
<p>We have all of the pieces of our space scene in place, so all that is left is 
one final finishing touch.</p>
