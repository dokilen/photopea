<font face="Times New Roman"><p>This first step is an introduction to 
the basics of Photopea. It will cover such basic items as Photopea's interface, 
menu, file type, and some other basic info. If you are familiar with Photopea 
then some of this information will be a review, but if you have never used 
Photopea then this information will be very important to helping you become 
familiar with the software.</p>

<p>Photopea is an advertising-supported software. It is an advanced image editing program that was <font color="#FF0000">originally developed 
as a free alternative to Photoshop </font>in 2013 by <font color="#FF0000">Ivan 
Kuckir</font>. It is a raster graphic editor that can be run through a browser 
(and thus is actually considered an <i><font color="#FF0000">app</font>.)</i> It 
is compatible with Photoshop's proprietary PSD file format, but can also save 
files as JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, PDF, and several other formats. While Photopea is 
browser based, it stores all files locally and <font color="#FF0000">does not 
upload any files to a server</font>. This helps to protect user's work.</p>
<p>While Photopea was originally designed to work with raster images as 
mentioned above, it does possess the ability to work with vector images (though it does have 
significant limitations).</p>
<ul>
  <li> <font color="#FF0000">Raster images are composed 
of groups of 
individual pixels and allow each pixel to be a separate color.</font></li>
  <li> 
<font color="#FF0000">Vector images 
are created through a system of points and lines connected using mathematical 
relationships.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>The images above are shown larger than their normal size to emphasize that 
the larger you make a raster image the more distorted it will become while a 
vector image will remain clean and pretty no matter how big or small you make it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's jump in now and examine the Photopea interface. </p>
<ol>















<font face="Times New Roman">
  <li>Open your favorite browser - this tutorial will assume you are using 
	Chrome and all screenshots will be from the Chrome browser</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that while I will be assuming that you are using Chrome, Photopea will 
work in any browser and look (pretty much) the same.</p>
</font>

<p>Below is a screenshot of what you will likely see...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/101.jpg" width="1000" height="505"></p>
<p>This is called the Start workspace and allows you to select from a variety of 
tasks to get started with.</p>

			I want to take a quick second here for a short aside (which is where 
			the speaker talks for a moment about something related to the main 
			topic, in this case Photopea, but not absolutely necessary for the 
			listener, YOU, to be familiar with). I want to point out that 
			Photopea can actually be downloaded onto your device. When working 
			with Photopea, you can go to the webpage as described above and then 
			disconnect from the Internet - Photopea runs entirely from your 
			browser's cache and sends no files to any server on the Internet so 
			your files are secure.<p>However, there is a way to download 
			Photopea so that it appears as a application your device. If you are 
			using your own device, you can follow these directions to download 
			Photopea to it. If you are in a lab or using a school supplied 
			device, check with your instructor before attempting to download 
			Photopea.</p>
			<p>Installing Photopea to your device:</p>
			<ol type="I">
				<li>















<font face="Times New Roman">
  				Go to <a href="http://www.photopea.com">www.photopea.com</a></font></li>
</font>
<font face="Times New Roman">
				<li>Click More and then click Install Photopea...<br>
<font face="times new roman">
  <img border="0" src="01/103.jpg" width="220" height="244"></font></li>
</font>
<font face="times new roman">
				<li>Be patient while Photopea is loaded to your machine</li>
				<li>When finished, you should notice that Photopea is no longer 
				running inside your browser...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/105.jpg" width="631" height="396"><br>
				and that a program entry has been created in your program list</li>
			</ol>
			<p>From now on when you want to run Photopea, you can simply open 
			the program from your program list as with any other program on your 
			device. In other words, you do not have to go to photopea.com to run 
			Photopea. Additionally, you are no longer hampered by quirky 
			browsers that crash or restart for no reason. Use this power for 
			good only.</p>
			<p>OK, back to our originally scheduled tutorial.</p>

<p>Before we can start working on our photograph, we need to take the picture. </p>
<p>We need a picture that we can open up in Photopea so we can get some 
experience with the Photopea environment. You will need to take a picture of 
yourself (or better yet have someone else take a picture of you) that we will 
use for this project. Now, before you just start snapping pictures (or worse 
than that use a picture that you have already taken), there are some picture 
guidelines you need to follow:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You need to be facing the camera</li>
	<li>Your face needs to be visible</li>
	<li>It is easier to work through this project if your background is a solid 
	color that is different from your face, hair, or clothes (though as you will 
	see from the image I will be using in these directions, this is not really 
	all that important, it will just make your life a little easier)</li>
	<li>Both of your eyes must be open and visible</li>
	<li>If you wear glasses, you are probably better off removing them for the 
	picture (otherwise you will have to draw them in when you turn yourself into a 
	cartoon)</li>
	<li>The picture should go from just above your shoulders to over your head 
	(see my image below)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li>Have your picture taken using the above guidelines</li>
	<li>Save your picture on the same device you will use to work with Photopea</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have your picture ready to go, let's open it up in Photopea. 
Since this is an existing image, let's go with the Open From Computer option.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Click Open From Computer...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/102.jpg" width="350" height="115"><br>
  The Open window appears...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/130.jpg" width="700" height="494"><br>
	Of course, if you are on a mac, tablet, Chromebook, phone, or anything other 
	than a PC then your screen will look different - I'm on a PC so this is what 
	I see</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Go to the folder where you saved your picture and double-click it, which will open your 
  picture in Photopea...<br>
	<img border="0" src="01/131.jpg" width="528" height="292"></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a few minutes and have a look around Photopea and get familiar 
with the interface. The Black Theme (the fact that everything around your image 
is black) is the default setting for Photopea, just like it is in Photoshop. 
This look was chosen by 
Adobe because its developers claim that it helps to make using the software a more immersive 
experience and allows users to focus on the image and not on the interface 
itself. Unfortunately, using such strong colors in the interface can actually 
trick your eyes into thinking the image you are editing is brighter or darker 
than it really is. Let's take a second to edit the display and change the 
hard-to-look-at-black background to a nice light gray color.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>On the Menu bar at the top of the screen, click <b>More</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/132.jpg"></li>
  <li>In the pop-out menu, point at Theme and then click Silver...<br>
  <img border="0" src="01/133.jpg"><br>
	Notice that Photopea is now a much nicer and 
  easier-on-the-eyes light gray color</li>
</ol>
<p>Now for the reality of this tutorial: I don't really care what Theme you use. 
If you like the Black Theme then use it. Just know that for the remainder of 
this tutorial, I will be using the Silver Theme, so if you use a different Theme 
than I am using then your screen will not look like my screenshots</p>
<hr>
<p>Photopea places the tools for working with images in <font color="#FF0000">five main sections</font>:</p>
<ol type="I">
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Menu bar</font></li>
  <li>















<font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">Tools panel</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Options bar</font></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Panels</font></li>
	<li><font color="#FF0000">Docked Panels</font></li>
</ol>
<p>These five sections, along with the <font color="#FF0000">Document window 
(where you actually see and manipulate your image)</font>, make up the Photopea 
interface. Let's take a quick look at each section.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Application bar</b></p>
<p>Across the very top of screen is the <b>Application</b> <b>bar</b> (includes File, 
Edit, Image, etc. - also known as the Menu bar). This bar is common to most Windows and Mac based programs and 
operates the same in all of them. Near the end of the menu bar is the <b>Window</b> 
button...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/107.jpg"></p>
<p>When you click it, a drop-down menu appears that allows you to choose which 
tool panels you want to show in your workspace. This is a quick and easy way to 
show the panels that you need without having to hunt around for them.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Application bar is common to computer programs, Photopea has four 
unique areas we need to discuss: Tools panel, Options, bar, Panel section, and 
Docked Panels. Let's look at each one in more depth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tools panel</b></p>
<p>The Tools panel should be visible to you on the left side of your screen. Take a look at the tools 
Photopea offers. Remember that any tool that has a little arrow to its lower right 
has more than one mode. You can either right-click a button or click it and 
hover for a second to see all of its modes.</p>
<p>
Here's a screenshot of  Photopea's Tools panel (yours is probably one column 
- this is fine, I just put the image in two columns to made it fit easier on the 
page)...</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="01/108.jpg" align="left">Many of the more useful tools are expanded to show all their varieties, 
and labels are on some other useful parts. It's a good idea to leave the tools 
with multiple varieties set to the ones you see selected here, since we'll be using 
many of these tool later.</p>
<p>The top batch of tools has to do with selection and basic editing. The <b>
Rectangle Select</b> tools can select 
areas in the shape of rectangles and circles. Any selected area will be outlined with a black and white 
dashed line. Any actions you do will be confined to that area. 
<font color="#FF0000">The 
selection can be cancelled by clicking <b>Select</b> on the Menu bar and choosing
</font> <span class="style1"><b>Deselect</b>, 
or pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b></span> on the keyboard (this is a useful shortcut -
<span class="style2"> remember it!</span>). 
Other important tools in this batch are <b>Move</b> (allows you to 
drag around a selected area), <b>Lasso</b> (for drawing your own selected areas),  
<span class="style1"><b>Magic Wand</b> (for 
selecting an area of similar colors)</span>, and <b>Crop</b> (to remove unwanted 
portions of your image). The 
<b>Eyedropper</b> 
tool is also good to know, since you can use it to pick colors to work with from an existing 
picture.</p>
<p>The next batch is the freehand tools. The most important ones are the <b>Brush</b> tool (which draws 
with color), and the <b>Pencil</b> tool (for coloring solid pixels). The <b>Eraser</b> tool works like the brush 
tool, except that it turns things transparent instead of drawing. The <b>Paint Bucket</b> tool is good for 
filling areas with a color or pattern.</p>
<p>Next, we have some <span class="style1">vector tools. There are several important buttons in this section, such as 
    <b>Text</b>, <b>Pen</b>, and <b>Direct Selection</b></span>. Many of these tools work by storing data about lines instead of 
data about pixels. This means we can resize these items without having to worry about the blurring 
that often happens when graphics are resized. We'll give you a break and say don't worry about these 
too much right now.</p>
<p>Under these are some miscellaneous tools. The <b>Hand</b> and the <b>Zoom</b> 
tools are very important, 
because they can be used to pan and zoom your view of the image you're working on. It's good to know 
the keyboard shortcuts for these: <span class="style1"><b>Ctrl+Plus key</b> zooms in and <b>Ctrl+Minus 
key</b> zooms out</span>, and clicking and dragging the mouse while the space 
bar is pressed will pan the picture.</p>
<p>Near the 
bottom of the Tools panel you see a colored square over two smaller buttons (a 
double-headed arrow button and a button with a D on it) with another colored 
square under them. The top colored square is the 
<b>foreground</b> 
color (in the example picture to the left it is the large red square), which is the color that all the drawing tools use. The 
colored square under 
(the large yellow square) is the 
<b>background</b> 
color, which is the color that the eraser uses on a layer that cannot be transparent. These colors 
can be changed by clicking on them (clicking on them opens the Color Picker, 
which is explained in more detail in <a href="step07.html">Step 07</a>). <span class="style1">The little 
double-arrow button between the foreground and background color squares swaps the foreground and 
background colors</span>. The tiny button with the D on it restores the foreground 
color to Black and the background color to White (these are their default 
colors, which is where the D comes from).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Options bar</b></p>
<p>When we select a tool, the top of Photopea will offer up a group of options 
that allow us to customize the tool to complete a variety of tasks. Let's take a 
quick look at this area.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>Select the <b>Brush</b> tool. There's a bar near the 
  top of the screen that will change and look like the image below...<br>
  <font color="#800000">
  <img border="0" src="01/110.jpg"></font></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the<b> Tools Options bar</b>. Although every tool in the Tool panel has its own set of 
options here, some are pretty common. On the very left is a pull down menu you can use to store 
presets of the current tool (it is that little arrow just to the right of 
the paintbrush in the image above), which is very useful for defining customized variations of a tool that 
you'll re-use a lot.  Blend Mode: is another common one, and works a lot like the  mode of a layer 
(which we will cover later). 
We will want this set to Normal for most things that we do.</p>
<p><b>Panels</b></p>
<p>On the right side of the Photopea screen you will see several different 
Panels, or small windows. There are quite of few of these Panels available in 
Photopea (there are over 20 of them), and they will be of great importance to you as you 
work with Photopea because they contain tools and information you will 
  use often. At this point you can see the History and Layers panels. These are 
two of the most important panels in Photopea. It is a good idea for the Layers 
panel to be large, and to know where the History panel is so you can quickly 
correct mistakes.
The History and Layer panels are indicated by red arrows below...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/112.jpg"></p>
<p>You can rearrange these panels by dragging their tabs (the area that contains 
the name of the panel at the top) left and right within their panel group. As you use Photopea, you'll discover what Panels are most 
important to you, and you can place them where you like (for now, leave them 
alone).</p>
<p>
You will get a chance to work with many of Photopea's Panels as you go through 
this tutorial, but let's take a quick second to have a closer look at the 
History panel...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="01/113.jpg"></p>
<p>The <span class="style1">History Panel allows you to undo multiple actions all at once</span>. The list in the window shows the recent actions 
you've taken, with the most recent on the bottom. Clicking on previous steps undoes any actions done 
since that step (for example, if you click 4 steps up the list, Photopea will undo everything you 
did after that point). The <span class="style1">shortcut to undo the very last action 
you did is <b>Ctrl+Z</b></span>, which is very useful when drawing. Keep in mind that every change you make to a graphic will be saved in the 
History panel, no matter how small the change. So if you make a large number of tiny changes you 
may have to go pretty far up the history list to undo them all.</p>
<p>By default, Photopea remembers <font color="#FF0000">30 history states</font> (in other words, Photopea 
remembers 30 individual changes you made, no matter how small, to your image). 
This is not a very large number of states, especially if you are making lots and lots of 
changes to your image as we are going to do. Photopea does the ability to save 
more history states, but to get that you have to pay for the premium version. 
Since we are a school and none of us have any money, we are going to have to 
live with the 30 history states. Just keep in mind as you are working that you 
only have 30 undos.</p>
<p><b>Docked Panels</b></p>
<p>Docked Panels appear just to the left of the Panel area and are a vertical 
sequence of icons with shortcut names on them...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/114.jpg" width="55" height="293"></p>
<p>Clicking any of these icons will expand the respective panel so that the 
entire panel is visible. For instance, if we click on the Cha icon in the above 
image we get this...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01/115.jpg" width="325" height="298"></p>
<p>This is the Character panel that allows us to modify any text we are working 
with. To collapse the panel back into a docked panel, simply click on the same 
icon (in our example above, you would click back on the Cha icon).</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we move on to actually working with your face, let's take a look at a 
few additional useful keyboard shortcuts in Photopea.</p>
