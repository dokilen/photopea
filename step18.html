<p>Before we can launch ourselves into space we need a ship. Luckily for you, I 
have already created one (you're welcome), but it is unfinished. We will take 
time in this step to give our ship some color, give it a name and a logo, and 
prepare it for flight.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you still have your Space file open go ahead and close it now - we 
    will not need it again until Step 20</li>
    <li>Open <b>Photopea</b> and surf to the <b>techclass\Mr. OKilen\Template\GDI\Photopea 
    Tutorial</b> folder and open the file named <b>Ship.psd</b>...<b><br>
    <img border="0" src="18/1801.jpg" width="346" height="223"></b></li>
  </ol>
<p>You may notice at this point that your ship lacks color in several places. 
Your first task will be to select a color and fill in the four areas of your ship 
that need color...</p>
<p align="center"><b>
    <img border="0" src="18/1802.jpg" width="346" height="223"></b></p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Decide what color you want to use to fill in your ship - I'm going to fill 
  the four areas of my ship with red</li>
</ol>
<p>You have probably noticed by now that I have already provided you with two layers 
in your layer stack...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="18/1803.jpg" width="239" height="112"></p>
<p>The <b>Color</b> layer contains a simple, solid outline of 
your ship that you will insert your color on. The <b>Ship</b> layer contains a 
feathered outline of your ship, the white portions, the flame at the back, and 
is locked (don't mess with it). 
By using two different layers to add in our color, we can be certain that we 
don't mess up the body of the ship itself and that all of our color sits on one 
layer.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Set the <b>Foreground Color</b> to the color you chose in direction 3</li>
  <li>Make sure the visibility of both layers is turned <b>on</b></li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Color</b> layer is the active layer</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Paint Bucket Tool </b> </li>
  <li><b>Click</b> each of the four areas to add color to them, you should end up with 
  a ship that is similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="18/1804.jpg" width="341" height="213"></li>
</ol>
If you are happy with the color you added you may skip ahead to direction 10. 
I'm going to give you an opportunity to customize your ship a little by 
choosing a second color if you want. You are free to set the fins to one color and the other 
two areas to a different color. This allows for the creation of some interesting color combinations...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="18/1805.jpg" width="529" height="120"></p>
<p>Avoid the temptation to use more than two colors as adding in a bunch of 
different colors tends to make these cartoon ships look ridiculous. <b>Also, DO NOT change the 
white areas of the ship.</b> We will need the body to remain white so we can 
easily read the ship name we will be adding in just a second.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>If you wish, choose a second color and <b>click</b> on each fin</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's get our beautifully colored ship onto one layer.</p>
<ol start="10">
  <li><b>Select</b> both layers then <b>right-click</b> on one of them and click
  <b>Merge Layers</b> 
  - notice that the new layer is named Ship (do you remember why?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's give our ship a name. The coolest ship names 
begin with U.S.S. (which, by the way, stands for United States Ship), so this is 
how we are going to start our ship name. We need to use the Type Tool to add in 
our ship name.</p>
<ol start="11">
  <li>Click the <span class="style1">Horizontal Type Tool</span>...<b><br>
  <img border="0" src="18/1806.jpg" width="41" height="52"><br>
  </b>Notice the cursor changes to an <span class="style3">I-bar (this indicates that you can type in text)</span>...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1807.jpg" width="35" height="31"></b></li>
  <li><b>Click</b> inside your spaceship and <b>drag</b> to create a box...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1808.jpg" width="291" height="159"></b></li>
  <li>When you release the mouse you should see a text box, as in the graphic 
  below...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1809.jpg" width="290" height="135"><br>
  </b>Notice that Photopea creates a layer in the Layers panel called
  <b>Layer 1</b> (if the layer is named something else don't worry about it - it 
  will change in a minute) and that a <b>T</b> shows in the layer icon to let you know 
  that the layer contains text...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1810.jpg" width="240" height="112"></b></li>
  <li>Adjust the <b>Options</b> bar so that it matches the settings below...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1811.jpg" width="909" height="35"><br>
  </b>You are free to use a different font if you like, but be sure that it is 
  large enough to be easily seen on your spaceship and is not some strange font 
  that is impossible to read</li>
  <li>Type </font>
<font face="Tekton Pro Ext">

  <b>U.S.S.</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">

  followed by your last name in all caps...<br>
  </font>
  <b>
<font face="Times New Roman">

  <img border="0" src="18/1812.jpg" width="224" height="76"><br>
  Just put your last name - I do not want to see </font>
<font face="Tekton Pro Ext">

  U.S.S. RILEYISGREAT</font><font face="Times New Roman">

  or </font>
<font face="Tekton Pro Ext">

  U.S.S. TRAVIS GOT SWAG</font><font face="Times New Roman">

  or anything else like that - use only your last name or I will take 
  off points - <u>LOTS OF POINTS</u></font></b><font face="Times New Roman"></li>
  <li>Your name is likely not in the perfect spot (notice how mine goes over the 
  red portion of the ship in the image above), so let's move it by clicking 
  the <b>Move Tool</b> (remember where that is?)</li>
  <li><b>Click</b> on your name and <b>drag</b> it into place - it should be in about the same 
  position as the name in the image below (if you just have to move it a small amount you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard)...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1813.jpg" width="239" height="108"></b><br>
  BTW, if you have a long last name, feel free to put the </font>
<font face="Tekton Pro Ext">

  U.S.S.</font><font face="Times New Roman">

  and your name 
  on two different lines...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1814.jpg" width="235" height="98"></b></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the layer that contains your text is now named whatever you typed 
on the layer...</p>
<p align="center">
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1820.jpg" width="240" height="105"></b></p>
<p>This is very helpful as it will allow us to quickly tell the 
difference between different text layers.</p>
Now comes the part where you get to be really creative. In the space above your name, 
you need to add in a graphic of your choice to personalize your spaceship.<ol start="18">
  <li>Use the <b>Internet</b> to locate an image you want to include on your 
  ship (remember that it needs to be an image that does not have a great deal of 
  tiny details as these will be lost when you resize the image and place it on 
  your ship) - here is the image I will be using...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1815.jpg" width="159" height="159"></b><b><font color="#800000"><br>
  </font><font size="4">Remember that this is a school project and the image you 
  choose MUST be appropriate for use in school</font></b></li>
  <li>Once you locate your personal image on the Internet, <b>save</b> it to your <b>
	Photopea</b> folder</li>
  <li><b>Open</b> your personal image in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li>We need to see both your spaceship and your personal image at the same 
  time, so we need to take your personal image off of Maximize, so locate the Document Title 
  of your personal image and <b>right-click</b> 
  on it and then click <b>Move to New Window</b>...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1816.jpg" width="284" height="204"><br>
  </b>Photopea should place your personal image in its own window and put it in 
  the upper left corner - if you need to reposition your personal image so you 
  can see both images at the same time, you can click 
  on the title bar and drag the image where you need it to be</li>
  <li>Using the <b>Move Tool</b>, click on your personal image and <b>
  drag</b> it onto your spaceship...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1817.jpg" width="518" height="429"></b><br>
  Notice that Photopea creates a new layer and automatically places your image 
  on it...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1821.jpg" width="239" height="140"></b><br>
  (if this does not work for you, you may need to click your personal image and 
  press <span class="style3"><strong>Ctrl+A</strong> [this is the keyboard shortcut to select everything]</span> 
  to select it then press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> to copy it and then click your 
  spaceship and press <strong>Ctrl+V</strong> to paste your image)</li>
  <li><b>Close</b> the original personal image file...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1822.jpg" width="191" height="125"></b><br>
  If Photopea asks if you want to save it, click No</li>
  <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer containing your personal image to <b>Image</b>...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1823.jpg" width="239" height="145"></b></li>
  <li>If there are any parts of your personal image that you do not want 
  included in your finished project, or if you want to alter the image in any way, use whatever method is appropriate (Magic Wand Tool, 
  Eraser Tool, Levels Editor, Brush Tool, Crop Tool, or whatever works) to <b>remove</b> or
  <b>change</b> anything you don't want - in my image for example, I removed the green color around my image 
  (otherwise I would have had an odd looking 
  square instead of a really cool circle)...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1818.jpg" width="239" height="219"></b><br>
  By the way, removing the color was easy: I simply clicked on the color with 
  the Magic Wand Tool to select the color and then pressed the Delete key</li>
  <li><b>Resize</b> your personal image so that it is the proper size for your 
  spaceship - remember that to resize things we can use <b>Edit</b> &gt; <b>
  Transform</b> &gt; <b>Scale</b></li>
  <li>Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to place your personal image in the correct 
  position on your spaceship...<br>
  <b><img border="0" src="18/1819.jpg" width="322" height="202"></b></li>
  <li><b>Save</b> your spaceship file in your <b>Photopea</b> folder as <b>
  Spaceship.psd</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Our ship is now ready to go, so let's work on getting our head in the image.</p>
