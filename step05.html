<p>We can now begin to create a nice, black outline version of our picture. We will work first on the 
long, unbroken lines in the image. We could simply draw our face freehand (and we 
will do some of this in the next step), but Photopea has a built-in system that will 
create smooth, perfect lines for us. This is accomplished using <b>Shape Inking</b>. Shape inking can seem pretty intimidating at first. It can seem like a horrible, 
technical, time-consuming, and complicated process. But, once you get a good sense of how to use the 
Pen tool, it really is easy to work with, comes in handy, and the lines it makes are pretty much flawless.</p>
<p>Before we get started, let's make sure we have the correct layer selected.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your <b>Face04</b> file in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Freehand</b>, <b>Backing</b>, and <b>Face</b> layers are 
  all 
  <b>locked</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="05/501.jpg" width="232" height="221"></li>
  <li>Make sure the <b>Cartoon</b> layer is selected (it 
  should be highlighted in gray like in the image above)</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><i><font size="5"><b>DRAW ONLY ON THE CARTOON 
LAYER - THIS IS </b></font><b><font size="6">VERY IMPORTANT!</font></b></i></p>
<p>If your Face layer is unlocked and you draw your cartoon lines on it then the lines you draw will merge with the blue 
image 
and will be impossible to separate,</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">AND YOU WILL HAVE TO
</font><font size="6"><i>START OVER</i></font></b>.</p>
<p>When working with Photopea, be sure that all changes you make are being 
placed on the correct layer. By keeping our cartoon and photograph layers separate 
we can turn the visibility 
of  our photo on and off as needed to see  our progress and compare the cartoon we 
are making with our original image.</p>
<hr>
<p>The two tools we'll be using are the <b>Pen</b> tool (located just under the 
Type tool) and the 
<b>Direct Select</b> tool (just under the Pen tool). We'll be using the Pen tool to draw points and the 
Direct Select tool to modify them. Before we get started, I should mention that 
there are actually several different ways to create nice, smooth lines using 
Photopea. We will cover just one, but this method will be useful in a large 
variety of situations you may encounter in the future.</p>
<p>When we create <span class="style1">Shapes, we are drawing adjustable lines 
with points on them, which Photopea calls knots, that can be moved around and 
used to adjust the shapes until we have them exactly where we want them. </span>Think of it as using a string to create a shape on the floor, then moving the string around any way 
we want to create any shape we want. Once we have the string in a position we like, 
we attach it to our surface.</p>
<p>Let's begin creating the outline of your face. </p>
<ol start="4">
      <li>Select the <b>Pen</b> tool...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/505.jpg"></li>
  <li>Go up to the Pen Tool options bar, and look at 
      the left side where you see this...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/506.jpg"></li>
    </ol>
<p>We need to make sure the correct tools are activated or the changes we 
  will be making to our graphic in the following steps will not work</p>
<ol start="6">
      <li>We want to make a shape, so make sure the <b>Pick 
      tool mode</b> selector is set to <b>
      Shape</b> (notice the word Shape in the above image - you want your screen 
      to have the exact same selection)</li>
    </ol>
<p align="center"><font color="#008080" size="4">
      <b><i>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - IF YOU DO NOT SELECT SHAPE
ALL KINDS OF 
STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN,
SO FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!</i></b></font></p>
<p>The Fill color is currently set to red, but we actually don't want a Fill 
color at all. If a Fill color is defined, Potopea will try to make our outline 
into a complete shape. We just want an outline, so let's set the Fill color to 
nothing.</p>
<ol start="7">
	<li>Click the Fill color box...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/502.jpg" width="75" height="40"><br>
	This will open the Fill color pop-up window...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/503.jpg" width="270" height="117"></li>
	<li>Click the white box with red X...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/504.jpg" width="79" height="79"><br>
	This will turn off the fill color</li>
	<li>Press the Esc key to remove the Fill color pop-up window</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's set the Stroke color to black.</p>
<ol start="10">
	<li>Click the Stroke color box...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/527.jpg" width="100" height="40"><br>
	This will open the Stroke color pop-up window...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/528.jpg" width="283" height="59"></li>
	<li>Click the black color box...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/529.jpg" width="66" height="94"><br>
	This will expand the color selector...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/530.jpg" width="282" height="124"><br>
	and select black as the Stroke color</li>
	<li>Press the <b>Esc</b> key to remove the Stroke color pop-up window</li>
</ol>
<p>The last thing we need to do is set the width of the line. This will depend 
on the size of the image each of us is working with, so I can't give you an 
exact amount. Not having an exact number is not a problem though as Photopea 
allows us to adjust the size of our line after we draw it to whatever size works 
best. </p>
<p>For my image, I'm going to set my Stroke width to 4.0. The following 
directions cover how to set the Stroke width to 4.0, and after we draw the line 
we will discuss how to adjust it to fit your image.</p>
<ol start="13">
	<li>Double-click the Stroke Width box to select the value in it...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/531.jpg" width="117" height="51"></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's all set the size to 4, and we can adjust the value later.</p>
<ol start="14">
	<li>Type <b>4</b>...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/532.jpg" width="120" height="55"></li>
	<li>Press Enter</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's start creating our first shape just above your ear.
When using the Pen tool, clicking the left mouse button places an knot. If you drag the 
mouse a little bit while holding the mouse button  down, you can create 
adjustment handles. If you don't add adjustment handles, the shape will just be a straight line to the next point you make 
and the curves it makes will be crappy. <font color="#FF0000">So the 
starting direction line is how you get Photopea to make nice, pretty curves</font><font color="#800000">.</font> 
Take a look at the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="05/541.jpg" width="343" height="258"></p>
<p>The blue circle is the knot that I dropped, the lines are the direction lines (when you drag the mouse, the direction lines are drawn an 
equal distance on each side of the knot), and the <font color="#FF0000">white dots are the adjustment 
handles</font>. 
Remember that if you 
    put a knot in the wrong place, you can hit the <b>Delete</b> key to get rid of it.
    </p>
    <ol start="16">
      <li>If you skipped the section above, go back and <b>READ IT</b> as it 
      contains important information you need to know about the Pen tool</li>
      <li>Make sure once again that you are on the correct layer - your
      <strong>Cartoon</strong> layer should currently be highlighted in blue and 
      the other two layers should be locked</li>
      <li><b>Left click</b> just above your ear and while <b>holding down</b> the mouse button <b>drag</b> it up a little bit in the direction you want the shape to 
      go (this will get the direction line to 
      display) then <b>release</b> the mouse button - you should now have something similar to the 
      image below...<br>
		<img border="0" src="05/540.jpg"><br>If you just clicked and didn't drag, just delete that point and do it 
      correctly - if you don't get the direction line it will be difficult to 
      create nice, smooth lines</li>
    </ol>
<p>Let's take a quick look at what is going on with our Layers panel. You may 
notice that a small box has appeared on your Cartoon layer's thumbnail...</p>
<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="05/507.jpg" width="264" height="197"></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">That little box indicates that the layer contains a vector element</font>. When 
painting with the Brush tool, we are creating a raster image, but 
<font color="#FF0000">when using the 
Shape tool </font>(or the Path tool, which is the other Pen tool option) 
<font color="#FF0000">we are 
actually creating a vector element</font> that can rearranged and resized with no 
distortion. While our shapes will start as vector elements, we will quickly and 
easily convert them raster layers later on.</p>
<p>Make sure one more time that your Cartoon layer is currently selected and 
that three layers are locked. If the Cartoon layer 
      is not the active layer, delete your knot by pressing the Delete key and 
then click the Cartoon layer to make it the active layer (it should be 
highlighted in gray).</p>
<ol start="19">
      <li>Move about half way up the side of your face and <b>click 
      again</b> then <b>drag</b> the mouse 
      around until the line between the 
      two points you created matches the curve of your face - note that at this point you can move the mouse 
      up and down or left and right to get the line that Photopea inserted 
      between the two points to curve how you like it</li>
    </ol>

<p>When working with shapes, we want to keep the lines simple and not too 
complicated. In the graphic above you can see that I am only using 3 points to 
create the curve and that I am only doing half of the top of his head. I could 
certainly do more of the head at once, but by using short, easy to work with 
lines I can make sure that I make an accurate outline.</p>

    <p>Ok, back to work. Now that we have some knots in place, let's take a 
	moment to look at how we can move existing knots and adjust the shape lines 
	between them.</p>
    <ol start="21">
      <li>Click the <font color="ff0000"><b>Direct 
      Select Tool</b> (this tool allows us to adjust the points we placed with our Pen Tool)</font>...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/514.jpg"><br>
      If you don't see the Direct Select Tool it is because the Path 
      Select Tool is currently selected - right-click the Path Select Tool 
      and in the menu that pops up...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/526.jpg"><br>
      Select the Direct Select Tool</li>
      <li><b>Press and hold the Alt key</b> then <b>roll 
      the mouse wheel up</b> to <b>zoom in</b> so you can see the entire shape 
      and some of the area around 
      it (basically what you see in direction 20 above) - keep in mind that you will want to see at least some of the surrounding area as this will 
      help you when setting up your lines and curves</li>
      <li>Click to select any of the three points that need to be adjusted (when attempting to select a point, 
		Photopea will put a white circle around it when you point at it...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/509.jpg" width="208" height="128"><br>
		to let you know that if you click at that point you will select it)</li>
		<li>Once you select a knot, you will able to select and adjust the lines 
		coming off of it by using the adjustment handles...<br>
      <img border="0" src="05/533.jpg" width="469" height="338"></li>
		<li>Take some time now to adjust the knots and experiment with both the 
		ingoing and outgoing curve vectors (those lines coming off the knot in each direction 
		with adjustment handles at the end of tem) 
      - this method of curves is very flexible, so <b>take your time</b> and make 
      sure your curve is perfect</li>
		<li>Adjust your knots and lines so that the curve matches the curve of 
		your head</li>
    </ol>
<p>The last thing we need to do before we convert our shape into an actual line 
is to make sure that it is the proper width for our image.</p>
<ol start="27">
	<li>Take a look at the image in direction <b>24</b> above and note how wide 
	my line is compared to my head - this is about the width of the line you 
	want</li>
	<li>Click back on the <b>Pen</b> tool and use the <b>Stroke</b> width box to 
	adjust the size of your line so that is approximately the same size in your 
	image as it is in mine</li>
</ol>
<p>A quick word of warning here. You don't want the width of your line to be too 
wide (it will be difficult to create the more detailed areas of your image) or 
too thin (it will be difficult to fill the parts of your head with color). </p>
<p>Once you have a stroke you are happy with, let's convert it to an ordinary 
line. To do this, we need to simply convert the layer that the shape is on into 
a raster layer. Remember how I mentioned that drawing with the Brush tool 
creates raster images while drawing with the Pen tool creates vector images. 
Luckily for us, Photopea has a quick and easy way to <font color="#FF0000">convert vector layers to 
raster layers: the Rasterize tool</font>.</p>
    <ol start="29">
		<li>On the Layers panel, right click the Cartoon layer to open the 
		Layers panel pop-out menu..<br>
<img border="0" src="05/534.jpg" width="178" height="525"></li>
		<li>Click Rasterize (highlighted above)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that your the thumbnail for the Cartoon layer no longer has the small 
box icon that indicates the presence of a vector element and that your line is 
now a solid line without the path overlay...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="05/535.jpg" width="380" height="148"></p>
<p>At this point, we can no longer adjust our line using the adjustment handles, 
so I hope everything is where you want it (note that you could always press 
Ctrl+Z at this point to undo the Rasterize function and continue making 
adjustments to the line if you really need to).</p>
<p>You should now have something like this...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="05/520.jpg" width="232" height="235"></p>
    <p>We are now ready to create a shape 
    line around the rest of your head.</p>
    <ol start="31">
      <li><b>Start</b> where your last shape line ended and <b>
      click and drag</b> to the right to drop a knot (don't worry if the two 
		ends of the shapes do not line up exactly, we will worry about that 
		later)...<br>
<img border="0" src="05/536.jpg" width="357" height="126"></li>
</ol>
<p>You may notice at this point that something odd is going on with your Layers 
panel...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="05/537.jpg" width="239" height="274"></p>
<p>The Shape 1 layer was created by Photopea to hold the new shape you created 
in the above direction. Don't worry, this is not a problem, and is actually 
helpful for what we are doing as it will allow us to work with several more 
features of Photopea.</p>
<ol start="32">
      <li><b>Create</b> a shape that goes from the top of 
      your head to the other side of your head, so that you have something 
		similar to the image below...<br>
<img border="0" src="05/538.jpg" width="247" height="261"></li>
		<li>To convert our shape to a regular line (and get rid of the new layer 
		that Photopea created) right-click on the Shape 1 layer to open the 
		Layers panel pop-out menu and click Merge Down...<br>
<img border="0" src="05/515.jpg" width="225" height="126"><br>
		Notice that where we once had 5 layers we now have 4...<br>
<img border="0" src="05/516.jpg" width="510" height="194"></li>
</ol>
<p>You may notice something a little odd about your layers at this point. What 
happened to the Cartoon layer? The answer is simple: <font color="#FF0000">when 
you use Merge Down to combine two layers in Photopea, the newly created layer 
will be named whatever the top layer was originally named</font>, which in our 
case was the Shape 1 layer. It may seem like this is a big deal, but it is not. 
We will continue to create the shapes we need and merge our layers together, and 
when our entire head is outlined we will simply rename the layer back to 
Cartoon.</p>
<ol start="34">
		<li>Create shape lines around the remainder of the outline of your 
      head...<br><img border="0" src="05/522.jpg" width="191" height="221"><br>Remember to ink it a piece at a time 
		(perhaps do one 
      cheek, then your chin, then the other cheek, then one ear, then the other 
      ear) and then use Merge Down to merge the as we did before</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that while the Pen tool is good for the long, important lines, 
    <b>it should not be 
    used for every line in the picture!</b> It could be, but if your pictures 
    have many small lines like this one, you would simply be driven insane. 
    These small lines don't need the detail of the longer ones, so you would be 
    better off drawing them freehand with the mouse (which we will do in the 
    next step)</p>
    <ol start="35">
      <li>Continue using the <b>Pen</b> tool to create the 
      remaining <b>long</b> lines of your face - you want to do the following 
      parts:<ul><li> the outline of your face (which we did above)</li><li> ears 
        (if they are visible)</li>
      <li>hairline across your forehead</li>
      <li>your eyebrows</li>
      <li>shape of each eye</li>
      <li>nose</li>
      <li>mouth<li>outline of your neck - you will be 
  placing your face inside a spaceship in a later step, and if you have no neck 
  your face will appear to float...and a floating face flying through space is 
  just ridiculous</ol>
  <font color="#800000">
  </ul>
            </font>
<p align="left">When you finish the above step, you will have something like 
    this...
    <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/523.jpg" width="255" height="293"><br>
    <font size="2">Ain't he 
    handsome?</font><p align="left">Keep something very important in mind at this point - <b><font size="4">your cartoon needs to extend to the bottom of the 
image</font></b>. This will be very important to us when we create our Backing 
layer in <a href="step08.html">Step 08</a>...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/524.jpg" width="191" height="220"><br>
    <font size="2">We need to be able to select all of the pinkish area at once</font></p>
<p align="left">Notice that in the picture I'm using for this tutorial 
that the lines of the neck go all the way to the bottom of the image so that the 
entire head is one contained unit. This will allow me to quickly and easily 
select everything around my head with one click so that we are only left with 
our cartoon head. If you have long hair that extends out the bottom of the 
photo you can ink that, if not you will have to ink and add color to your 
clothes. Take a look at the two outlines below...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="05/525.jpg" width="556" height="279"></p>
<p align="left">
    In the left image, her hair was long enough that it extended out the bottom 
    of the image and thus no additional work on her clothes needed to be done. 
    In the right image however, she had to add shapes to her jacket and blouse so 
    that the cartoon extended all the way to the bottom of the image. It does 
    not matter at this point how you accomplish this, just make sure that your 
    shapes extend all the way to the bottom of the picture.</p>
<ol start="36">
	<li>
	<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Rename the layer containing 
	your lines to <b>Cartoon</b></font></p></li>
</ol>
<p align="left">
At this point our cartoon is not perfect - we are missing some important parts around the eyes and ears, 
but these are short lines that we can quickly add in using the Brush tool and simply freehand ink them in the next step.<ol start="37">
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">
	Click <b>File</b> then click <b>Save as PSD</b></font></li>
	<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">
	Name the file <b>Face05</b> (Face because it is the face file, and 05 because 
	this is Step 05)</font></li>
</ol>
