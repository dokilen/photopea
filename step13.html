  <p>For our first planet, we will cheat a little and create our fictitious 
  world from an existing satellite photo. I have a selection of photos for you 
  to choose from so you don't have to worry about finding your own image.</p>
  <p>Before we get started, keep the following in mind:</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">YOUR PLANET SHOULD REMAIN 
  SELECTED FROM DIRECTION 15 THRU DIRECTION 70. IF YOU HAPPEN TO DESELECT YOUR 
  PLANET, YOU CAN RESELECT IT BY PRESSING AND HOLDING THE Ctrl KEY AND CLICKING 
  ON THE PLANET LAYER'S THUMBNAIL</font></b><br>
  (the little picture between the eyeball 
  and the layer name)</p>
  <p>The first thing to do is select the satellite image you want to use to 
	create your planet.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open your <b>Space12</b> file in Photopea<li>Click <b>
    File</b> then click <b>Open...</b><br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1301.jpg" align="middle"><li>
    Go to the folder that contains these directions and go into 
	the subfolder named <b>planet</b><li>Click the <b>More Options</b> drop-down arrow...<br>

    and choose <b>Extra large icons</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1303.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    This will give you a good look at all 
    of your image choices</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are 125 satellite images for you to choose 
    from and each will create a different, unique planet, so choose wisely.</p>

</div>
  <p>Take a few minutes and look through the images and find something that you 
  really like. Let me warn you that many students will simply use the first (or 
  last) image for no other reason than the fact that it is the first (or last) 
  on the list. I would advise against this. You want to create a unique space 
  scene, and if your planet looks identical to 20 other student's planets then 
  your scene will not look very unique. If you want to use the first (or last) 
  image, make sure you are using it because you really like it and not because 
	you are too lazy to look through the images.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>When you find an image you like, double-click it to open it in Photopea</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Ellipse Select tool</b></li>
	<li>Make sure the <b>Feather</b> is set to <b>0</b>...<b><br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="13/1340.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key so you 
    get a perfect circle, then <b>click and drag</b> to create a circular 
    selection on an area of the image that you like and want to turn into your 
    planet - keep in mind that the larger the selection the better your 
    resulting planet 
    will be as this will 
    give your planet more detail in the end; the example we will use in this 
    tutorial 
    is shown below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1304.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Note that the circular selection area is indicated by the red arrow 
    above</li>
  </ol>
<p>If your circle is not in a place that you like after you draw it, you can 
always drag it around and reposition it. Just make sure that your cursor is the 
4 headed arrow that you see above.</p>
<ol start="9">
    <li>Once your circle is where you want it, press <b>Ctrl+C</b> to copy the selection</li>
	<li>We need to switch back to our Space12 file, so look just below the 
	Options bar and locate the open file names and click the Space12.psd file...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1305.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+V</b> to paste the planet - notice that Photopea 
    places the image on a new layer...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1333.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Return </b>to the satellite image and close the file - Photopea will 
	give you this message...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1341.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Click <b>OK</b> and the image will close</li>
    <li>Return to your space scene image and rename the new layer <b>Planet1</b></li>
    <li>Make sure all of your layer folders are locked - you should now have something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1306.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Once again we want to turn our flat image into an image that looks round 
    - press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key on the keyboard and click on the layer's thumbnail image 
    - this will select all of the non-transparent pixels on the layer (in this 
    case, it will select the planet)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1307.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Set the Amount to <b>100%</b> and click <b>OK</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>If your planet just suddenly doubled in size or changed into some strange oval 
  or other non-round 
  shape then you did not have the planet selected when you applied the Spherize 
  filter. Undo the Spherize and go back to direction <b>15</b> and <b>do it right</b>.</p>
  <ol start="18">
    <li>Take a look at your planet and determine if you are happy with how 
    spherical it looks - if not, repeat the Spherize, but turn down the Amount 
    (most of you will want the second Spherize to be applied with the Amount set to 50%)...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1308.jpg" width="323" height="308" align="middle"><br>
    When you are happy with how spherical your planet looks, move on to the next 
    direction</li>
  </ol>
<p>Satellite photos are 2d images and thus don't offer any contour to the 
planet's surface, so let's use a little Photopea magic to give our planet the 
illusion of some raised (like cliffs) and sunken (like valleys) areas.</p>
<ol start="19">
    <li><b>Duplicate</b> the Planet1 layer and rename the duplicate layer <b>
	Surface</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1334.jpg" align="middle" width="304" height="215"></li>
    <li><b>Lock </b>the Planet1 layer</li>
    <li><b>Select</b> the new Surface layer (it should be highlighted in gray as 
    in the image above) and click <b>Filter</b> and then click <b>Filter Gallery...<br>
	</b>
    <img border="0" src="13/1335.jpg" align="middle"><b><br>
	</b>This will open the Filter Gallery window...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1309.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>In the Filter Selector drop-down menu, choose <font color="#FF0000"><b>
	Bas Relief</b></font>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1342.jpg" width="281" height="366" align="middle"><br>
	<font color="#FF0000">T</font><span class="style1">his filter makes your image seem as though it has texture</span><font color="#FF0000"> 
    [or raised areas]</font>, or in this case that your planet has mountains and 
	valleys</li>
  </ol>
<p>A relief sculpture is one where the subject looks as though it has been 
raised out of the background...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="13/1343.png" width="571" height="383" align="middle"></p>
<p>Now, obviously the two horsemen were not raised out of the stone background 
behind them. Relief sculptures are accomplished by removing material from the 
top down and leaving the subject behind. And just to totally cover the topic 
here, the 'Bas' in Bas Relief comes from the French word for low, so Bas Relief 
literally refers to a piece with a subject slightly raised above the background. 
That is exactly what we are going for here - a slight rise from the background. 
Keep going and you will see just how this filter will impact our planet.</p>
<ol start="23">
    <li><b>Adjust</b> the setting so they resemble those below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1343.jpg" width="289" height="326" align="middle"><br>
	Your image should look something like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1344.jpg" width="278" height="278" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
<p>Since you are using a different image than me, yours will obviously not look 
exactly like mine. You do not even have to use the exact same settings as I did. 
You can adjust them to whatever you 
    like, but be careful that the degree of Bas Relief you have resembles the degree 
    in the above image. Any more or less and your image will not turn out 
    correctly.</p>
<ol start="24">
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> (remember that the blending mode is on 
    the Layers panel just to the left of Opacity) of the <b>Surface</b> layer to one of the 
    following...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1310.jpg" align="middle"><br>
    Which you choose is up to you, so test each and choose one that causes your 
    land to appear as though it actually has height and texture; I'm going to 
    use <b>Overlay</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1311.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Don't worry if it seems really bold - we will decrease the Opacity of the 
	Surface layer next to get it looking good</li>
	<li>Lower the Opacity of the Surface layer to something that looks good with 
	your image - I'm going to go with a setting of 50%...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1345.jpg" width="302" height="163" align="middle"><br>
	So that my image now looks like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1346.jpg" width="373" height="368" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
<p>Let's compare my planet before the Bas Relief filter and after...</p>
<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="13/1347.jpg" width="766" height="368" align="middle"></p>
<p>Notice that areas of shadows have been added - I put in some red arrows so 
you can see the difference more clearly - that resemble mountains and valleys. 
These areas add dimension to the planet and give the mountains and coastline 
    contour. The effect is subtle, but this is what we are going for so 
    that when we 
    add some clouds in the next direction, our image will have some depth to 
    it.</p>
<ol start="27">
    <li>If you are happy with your Surface layer, <b>lock</b> the Surface layer 
	(if you are not happy, you can always undo your work and try using a 
	different blending mode or various Opacity settings)</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of your layer stack and name it <b>Clouds1</b>...<b><br>
    </b>
    <img border="0" src="13/1336.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Make sure the <b>Clouds1</b> layer is selected</li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard</li>
	<li>If your planet is not selected, make a selection by Ctrl+clicking on the 
	Planet1 layer thumbnail</li>
    <li> <b>Fill</b> the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with black</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Make the Amount <b>100%</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the <b>Clouds1</b> layer to <b>Hard Light 
    - </b>you should now have a gentle covering of clouds...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1312.jpg" width="300" height="283" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Clouds1 layer</li>
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it <b>Clouds2</b></li>
    <li>Press <b>D</b> on the keyboard to set black as the Foreground color</li>
    <li> <b>Fill</b> the <b>CIRCULAR</b> selection with black</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Click back on <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Render</b> and click <b>Difference 
    Clouds</b></li>
    <li>Press <b>Ctrl+Alt+F</b> several times until you have a cloud pattern you like - 
    it should have large amounts of dark areas in it</li>
    <li>Click <b>Filter</b> then point at <b>Distort</b> and click <b>Spherize</b></li>
    <li>Make the Amount <b>100%</b></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Clouds2 layer to <b>Screen</b> 
    (also give Linear Dodge and Hard Light a try and see which of the 
    three you 
    like best) - you should now have a covering of both light and dark clouds...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1313.jpg" width="285" height="283" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Clouds2 layer</li>
  </ol>
  Now let's give our planet a nice shadow so that it looks like our sun is only 
shining on one side of the planet.<ol start="50">
    <li> <b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and name it
    <b>Shadow</b> (leave it selected!)</li>
    <li><b>Fill</b> the round selection with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Select the <b>Eraser Tool</b></li>
    <li>Set the Brush to <b>Soft Mechanical 24 pixels  </b> and adjust the Size to <b>500</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1314.jpg" align="middle"></li>
	<li>Press the Esc key to remove the Brush options pop-up window and compare 
	the 500 pixel sized brush to the actual size of your planet - adjust the size of your brush 
	(the [ key will decrease the brush size while the ] key will increase the 
	brush size) so that it is slightly larger than your 
	planet (see the image below)</li>
    <li>Position your cursor over your planet similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1337.jpg" width="349" height="318" align="middle"><br>
    Remember that you want to erase the black from the side of your planet 
    closest to your sun and leave the other side in shadow</li>
    <li>Click the mouse button several times to <b>Erase</b> the portion of the Shadow layer so that the planet shows 
    through on the side <b>toward</b> the sun (be careful not to erase too much 
    of the shadow) - you should now have something similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1315.jpg" width="280" height="282" align="middle"><br>
    Not a bad looking planet if you ask me :-)</li>
  </ol>
<p>It is pretty common at this point for students to erase too much of the 
shadow. Don't worry, this is just because you are not used to working with 
such a large Eraser in Photopea. If you remove too much shadow, just use Ctrl+Z to undo and try again. Your 
shadow should look very similar to mine when you are done.</p>
<ol start="57">
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Shadow layer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To add a little more realism to our planet, let's put a soft glow around 
  the edge to simulate the glow seen when sunlight reflects off the atmosphere.</p>
<ol start="58">
    <li> <b>Insert</b> a new layer at the top of the layer stack and rename it
    <b>Atmosphere</b></li>
    <li><b>Fill</b> the round selection with <b>black</b></li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Atmosphere layer to <b>Screen</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1316.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li><b>Double-click</b> the Atmosphere layer to open the <b>Layer Style</b> window</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Outer Glow</b> checkbox and set all of the options to match the 
    following image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1317.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Helpful hint: a quick and easy way to set the color to white (the tiny red 
	arrow above), is to click that color box and in the Color Picker that opens 
	simply enter ffffff for the Hex setting field...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1348.jpg" width="177" height="64" align="middle"><br>
	ffffff is the Hex code for white (you're welcome)</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Inner Glow</b> checkbox and set all of the options to match the 
    following image...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1318.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> - you should now have an image and layers similar to the image 
    below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1319.jpg" align="middle"><br>
	Note that if your Layers panel looks like this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1350.jpg" width="303" height="131" align="middle"><br>
	You simply need to click the black menu arrow (pointed at with the red arrow 
	above) to expand the layer and see the applied Effects (the tiny litte eff 
	on the layer is there to let you know that Effects have been applied)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We now need to get rid of the glow on the shadow side of the planet. 
  Unfortunately, we can't just grab the Eraser Tool and erase the glow because 
  it is not actually on the Atmosphere (remember that it is actually an effect 
  being applied to the black circle that is actually on the Atmosphere layer). 
  We need to convert the Atmosphere layer from a layer with an effect applied to 
  it to a regular layer. To do this, we will merge the Atmosphere layer with a 
  regular blank layer (this is a secret trick used by Graphic Designers...shhhhh, 
	don't tell anyone).</p>
<ol start="65">
    <li><b>Insert</b> a new layer (just leave it named whatever Photopea names 
    it) and make sure it is at the <b>top</b> of the layer 
    stack</li>
    <li><b>Select</b> both the <b>new layer</b> you just created and the <b>Atmosphere</b> 
    layer (select the new layer then press and hold Shift as you click the 
    Atmosphere layer)</li>
    <li>Press <span class="style1"><b>Ctrl+E</b> to have Photopea merge the two layers<font color="#000000"> 
    - don't freak out that it is no longer named Atmosphere, remember that when 
    you merge layers that Photopea gives the newly merged layer the name of 
    whatever layer was on top when you merged them</font></span></li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the newly merged layer back to <b>Atmosphere</b> - your planet 
    should now look similar to the image below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1320.jpg" width="241" height="239" align="middle"><br>
    The selection is filled with black again because the blending mode of the new 
    Atmosphere layer is no longer Screen (blending modes are always removed when 
	you merge layers)</li>
    <li>Change the <b>blending mode</b> of the Atmosphere layer back to <b>Screen</b></li>
    <li>Deselect your circle by pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b></li>
    <li><b>Move</b> the <b>Shadow</b> layer above the <b>Atmosphere</b> layer 
    (in other words, put Shadow at the top of the layer stack) - your planet 
    should now look similar to this...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1321.jpg" width="170" height="168" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our Atmosphere layer is now just a regular, every day layer. Let's erase 
  the glow from the shadow side.</p>
  <ol start="72">
    <li>Click the <b>Eraser Tool</b></li>
    <li>Make the <b>Atmosphere</b> layer the active layer (Atmosphere and <b>NOT</b> 
    Shadow)</li>
    <li>Use the same settings for the Eraser that you used in <b>direction 53</b> and erase 
    the glowing atmosphere from the shaded side of the planet - you should now have a planet similar to the one below...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1322.jpg" width="328" height="307" align="middle"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our planet now has a nice atmospheric glow, but there is a problem. Notice 
  the thin,  
    white border around the shadow side of my planet in the above image. The border of your planet 
  may be as visible as the border around my planet above, or it may be  
  harder to see, but it is there (this border exists because all of the layers we 
  have added above our initial Planet layer are just a tiny bit smaller than our planet). 
  To fix this little issue we will simply increase the size of our clouds, 
  atmosphere, and shadow layers a small amount.</p>
  <ol start="69">
    <li>Make the <b>Shadow</b> layer the active layer (this should be the top layer in 
    your layer stack) and press and hold the <b>Shift</b> key then click the <b>Clouds1</b>

  </ol>
  <p>At this point, let's take a quick second and make sure that we are happy 
  with our planet. Depending on how the cloud filter applied clouds to your 
  planet, your cloud cover is either perfect or a little too thick. Let's run a 
  quick test to see if we need to adjust our cloud layers.</p>
  <ol start="76">
    <li>Turn the <b>Opacity</b> of your <b>Cloud1</b> and <b>Cloud2</b> layers 
    down to <b>50%</b></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Take a look at the image below...</p>
  <p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="13/1339.jpg" width="525" height="250" align="middle"></p>
  <p>Notice that the difference between 100% Opacity and 50% Opacity on my 
  planet is not huge (note that in the 50% planet you can see additional 
  mountains near the top of the planet and the cloud cover over the ocean is 
  diminished). The lower the Opacity on the cloud layers the more visible your 
  surface features will be. I'm not going to tell you what Opacity setting to 
  use on your planet - you get to decide that for yourself.</p>
  <ol start="77">
    <li>Determine what level of cloud Opacity you want for your planet and set 
    your Opacity - note that you can set any level of Opacity you wish (you 
    could even set the two layers to different Opacity, so if you think Cloud1 
    should be set to 60% and Cloud2 should be set to 80%, then go for it), just 
    DO NOT fall below <b>50%</b> Opacity for each level</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now that our planet is complete, let's move all of our planet layers into a 
  layer group so we can adjust its size and reposition it in our scene.</p>
  <ol start="78">
    <li>Make sure all 6 layers that make up your planet are <b>unlocked</b></li>
    <li><b>Select</b> all six of the layers that make up your planet...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1330.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Click 
    the <b>New Folder</b> icon - this should place all of your layers into a 
	layer folder</li>
    <li><b>Rename</b> the new layer folder <b>Planet1</b>...<br>
    <img border="0" src="13/1331.jpg" align="middle"></li>
    <li>Turn on the visibility of all of your layer groups</li>
    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> and click <b>Scale</b> 
    and resize your planet to something more in scale with your sun (remember to 
    hold the <b>Shift</b> key and use one of the planet's corner resize handles 
    to resize your planet so it does not turn out egg shaped, which will cost 
	you points)</li>
    <li><b>Lock</b> the Planet1 layer group</li>
  </ol>
  With all of your layer groups and layers turned on, you should now have a space 
    scene similar to the one below...<p align="center">
    <img border="0" src="13/1332.jpg" width="502" height="502" align="middle"></p>
  <p>The really great part about this process for building a planet is that you 
  do not have to start with a satellite photo. You can use a hand-drawn image, a 
  photograph of any unique object, or even a unique pattern or brush stroke to 
  make a planet with a distinct surface.</p>
  <p>For our second planet, we are going to start from scratch and create a Saturn-like world complete 
  with rings.</p>
