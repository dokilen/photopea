<p>This step will finish off our  line work by filling in the smaller lines. 
Let's get started by making sure we have the right brush settings.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure your <b>Face05</b> file is open in Photopea</li>
  <li>Activate the <span class="style1"><b>Brush Tool</b> (this works best for freehand inking</span> because the lines we are going to make are pretty short)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/621.jpg" width="45" height="70"></li>
  <li>The Brush size should be set to the same size you used when creating your 
	Shapes in the last step...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/622.jpg" width="158" height="67"><br>
	Remember that I set mine to 4, but your size may be different</li>
</ol>
<p>We finally get to use our Freehand layer. Note that because our Freehand 
layer is sitting on top of our layer stack that whatever we draw on it will 
appear to hover over everything on the lower layers.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Lock the <b>Cartoon</b> layer so that we can be certain we do not make any 
  changes to it in this step - all layers should now be locked...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/609.jpg" width="256" height="181"></li>
  <li>Click the <b>Freehand</b> layer to make it the active layer - it should be 
  highlighted in gray...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/610.jpg" width="256" height="177"></li>
  <li>Unlock the <b>Freehand</b> layer...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/611.jpg" width="261" height="181"></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can begin drawing. Unlike a paint brush in real life, here you have the option to undo (by 
using <b>Ctrl+Z</b>) 
and remove the lines you draw. It might be helpful for you to keep one hand over the undo keys when 
drawing. If you're new to drawing with Photopea, keep in mind that using a mouse to draw won't come 
naturally the first time you try it. Like any tool, it may take some practice to get 
used to it.</p>
<p>Let's add the smaller lines to your face one piece at a time. Don't draw 
slowly or try to follow every single line exactly (your face will look very 
squiggly as though you were trying to draw it while riding a bike down a hill 
covered with rocks). Instead use short, quick strokes. How many lines you add is 
up to you, but don't over do it as the lines will begin to merge together. We 
want a general outline of your face, not a line for every single tiny thing.</p>
<p>As you work, be sure that you are drawing <b>only on the Freehand layer</b>. You should 
zoom in pretty far to ensure that your work follows the lines of your picture.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>If your ears are visible, draw in the small lines that make the creases 
  (folds in the skin on your ears), so that you go from something similar to 
  this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/620.jpg" width="251" height="182"><br>
  to something similar to this...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/612.jpg" width="300" height="169"><br>
  If you can't see your ears, just skip to the next direction</li>
  <li>Draw in the lines necessary to complete your eyes...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/614.jpg" width="312" height="165"><br>
  Don't go overboard as too many lines in the eyes will make it hard to see the 
  color you will add in the next step</li>
</ol>
<p>For my eyes, I put lines around the iris (the colored part of the eye) and 
the pupil (the dark center of the eye) as well as small lines between his 
eyeballs and his eyebrow to represent the crease he has there. What lines you 
add are up to you, just be sure not to go overboard.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>Draw in any lines you wish to include on your nose - for my image, I added 
  in a small curve to represent the little bump on the end of his nose...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/615.jpg" width="313" height="182"><br>
  Feel free to add more lines to your nose if you wish (if you can see your 
  nostrils, you can add black dots to represent them)</li>
  <li>Draw in any lines you wish to include to complete your mouth - for my 
  image, I added in some teeth lines...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/616.jpg" width="314" height="172"></li>
  <li>Add in any lines you wish to give contour to your cheeks...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/617.jpg" width="313" height="208"><br>
  I added two small curves on the cheeks and two tiny lines at the corners of 
  the mouth, but feel free to add in more lines if you wish</li>
  <li>Add in any additional lines that you wish (forehead, chin,  
  eyelashes, etc.), just be sure the lines you add to your image are not a 
  distraction - for example, if I were to add in eyelashes they would not look 
  very good since my guy has very small lashes...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/618.jpg" width="290" height="128"><br>
  So for me it actually looks better if I leave them out, but if they will work 
  on your cartoon then certainly add them in</li>
  <li>Decide if you want lines in your hair - if you do add them in now 
  (obviously you don't have to add in lines in your hair, but you can if you 
  wish - just make sure you do not over do it as too many lines  
  look bad); for my image, he actually looks better with no lines in his hair, 
  so I'm going to leave the hair blank</li>
</ol>
<p>Be careful not to go crazy with your lines. If you add in too many it will 
look ridiculous. Take a look at the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="06/619.jpg" width="272" height="314"><br>
  <i><font size="2">See...ridiculous...</font></i></p>
<p>You want just enough lines to give your face some nice contour so that you 
have a nice, complete face at this point.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="80%" id="AutoNumber3">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
      <p align="center">Keep something very important in mind: <b>
      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">YOU MUST FREEHAND INK</span></b> 
      some part of your face. Do not simply skip this step thinking that the 
      lines you already have look fine. Remember that the entire point of this 
      project is to learn how Photopea works and get experience using its 
      various tools. If you skip this step, not only will you get no 
      practice using the Brush Tool, but since I can't give you credit for work 
      you did not do, you lose points for this portion of the project.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>When complete, you should have something similar to the image below...</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="06/601.jpg" width="778" height="290"></p>
<p>Of course, your image will be different, but it should be as simple as the 
image above. If you have too many lines, the image will be overly complicated. 
What we want is a clean, simple image.</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li>Lock the <b>Freehand</b> layer</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to take some time now to make sure that our lines all match and that 
there are no gaps, which will cause problems when we try to add color in the 
next step.</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li>Make the <b>Cartoon</b> layer the active layer - make extra sure you are 
  drawing on the Cartoon layer</li>
  <li>Unlock the <b>Cartoon</b> layer</li>
  <li>Select a point on your head (such as the very top of 
  your head or the very bottom of your chin) and <b>zoom in</b> on your line - 
  you want to zoom in pretty far so that you get a good view of your line...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/623.jpg" width="331" height="133"></li>
  <li>Select the <b>Hand Tool</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/602.jpg"><br>
  This will allow you to reposition your image on the screen without actually 
  moving your line around on your layer</li>
  <li>Click and drag on your face to reposition it on the 
  screen and follow your lines and look 
  for any malformations (if you don't know what malformation means, go to
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/malformation">dictionary.com</a> 
  and look it up), 
  for example you may notice a gap...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/603.jpg" width="354" height="136"><br>
  or a spot where the lines do not match up well...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/604.jpg" width="169" height="190"><br>
  If you find any problems, continue with the next direction, if you don't 
  notice any problems after going over all of your lines then skip to the text 
	after direction 21</li>
  <li>To fill a gap, simply select the <b>Brush Tool</b> and 
  draw to fill 
  in the gap...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/605.jpg" width="350" height="111"></li>
  <li>To fix lines with ends that do not match, select the 
  <b>Eraser Tool</b>...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/606.jpg"><br>
  and remove the overlap portion of the line...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/607.jpg" width="340" height="190"><br>
  then use the <b>Brush Tool</b> to draw to fill in the gap...<br>
  <img border="0" src="06/608.jpg" width="511" height="190"></li>
</ol>
<p>Don't be too worried if your outline is not perfect. You will eventually (in 
<a href="step19.html">Step 19</a>) reduce your face to a much smaller size   
so you will not notice most imperfections. For example, you may notice that both of 
my corrections above are not absolutely perfect lines, they each have a slight 
bend to them. Notice also that I'm not freaking out about it because once my 
face is shrunk down those small deviations will not be noticeable. Remember that 
you are creating a cartoon version of yourself and thus it will not be a perfect 
duplicate of your actual face. This is good and what we want.</p>
<p>At this point your inking should be done. Don't worry if your outline does not look as good as 
mine - it shouldn't if this is your first time working with Photopea. That's OK - the more you work with the program the better 
your work will become. The only way to improve is to <i><b>practice</b></i>.</p>
